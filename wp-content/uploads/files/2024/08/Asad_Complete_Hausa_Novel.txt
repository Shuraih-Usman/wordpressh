After asad and ayats dinner meeting they came back to the office and everyone got back to work some minute later....asad heard voices at his front door which he could see a woman trying to force her way to his cabin he could see them all bcuz his cabin is  made wit glasses all over so its transparent,,,he got his telephone to call his secretary...nuriyah jst before he could dial the speedial botton she bump into his cabin...wit nuriya behind her...


Sorry sir i told her to wait outside bt she insisted on coming in on announce asad who is furiosly calm,rise his hands to nuriya to dismiss her.....

👉you dont get to talk to me like that you fool am your mother i gave birth to you,,even if the circumstance is not good i deserve respect for that...asad got up and rise his hand back at her...miss mehra is because of that same reason that am not beating you up ,,,and he walk away from her a little bit what is that about you being my mum when the only thing that connect us is the fact u brought me to the world,,,that feeling of having motherly love was giving to me by another woman who doesn't have the same thing you do then bt she took me and my dad and gave us hop of being loved.....


Asad she came close,,,pls listen to me i swear i didn't mean to leave you.....asad rise his hand wallahi in bakison nayi abinda zai damai mu....u should leave this building now.

He walked to the door and open it to see almost everyone looking at his office direction clearly they heard everything....the moment they saw him they started getting back to work,,,,some murmuring about him being so rude of talking to his mother like that,some of them were having sympathy for her while some where very sure she did something nasty thats making her son hate her,,,


She came closed to him and looked him well then nod asad duk abinda nayi i have my reason,,,just go away ma'am,,she rise both her hands in the air as a sign of defeat,🤷‍♀🤷‍♀,suit your self am leaving but make sure the money gets to me before the day ends of not am coming back tomorrow.....she turn to leave without even looking back even thou she saw some disgusting look on some of there faces she didnt care because she have seen it alot of time and it didn't bother her cuz she knows people are judgemental here in Nigerian people are more disturb wit other peoples live than thiers.


Asad turn from looking at the back of the woman who gave birth to him back,,,she only came here because she didn't gt the montly allowance,,,,,who is she does she rilly deserve to be anyones mother,he turn back and saw some of the looking at him.....


Hey you in the yellow computer or math stupid t.shirt or is it a polo,,,the guy dt he was talking to was stun,,,wat is that look on ur face,is dt a pittyful look the guy didnt say anything asad came out of his cabin and ask the boy which department are u working in...

After ayat and asad exhausting hours of meeting which ayat was the one doing the presentation the boss was only sitted there enjoying his food....

Asad and mr lukman shake hand,,,congratulations again mr asad you have sucessfully close another deal with our company and of course i knw you had help from your  assistant miss Abbas mr lukman was smirking at ayat as he was shaking asad.

*Guys help me o no b ayat do the presentation,cant she for once gt the credit from her work if not from you from people🤷‍♀🤷‍♀*

Asad came out of the restaurant furious for stupid show ayat and lukman put up says asad,,,he came close entered the car well ayat sat at the front with the driver,the ride back to the office was boring and quite,everyone with there thought.


Asad didn't even take his suitcase and existed the car ayat now was sure his angry she got out and help wit the bag and her's too plus her ipad and the files they used she knows asad left all his to punish her,,,she went to drop his stuffs and saw him drinking  what frm his mini fridge she gently keep everything and was ready to run for her life when he called her.

Ayat look at me when am talking you can't jst keep quite and stand like a statue when am talking,kina karuwanci da wani dan iska a gabana do i look stupid to the both of you.....

I quit,,,,,,,,,after saying all she wanted saying she got out of his office leaving him speechless,he never expected her to react like that.



What nerve of that girl to talk to me like that another voice inside him reply she really tried asad, she is the only assistant who stayed long working for you beside you went beyond your line today calling her a prostitute,,,asad sat down put both his hands on his hair,,,he breath out a loud and strong air,, 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂well her lost am not the one who told her to leave she can go and never come back.



Ayat on the other hand went into her officr cried her eyes out because she  was so hurt from his allegations,,she was sure she will not work for him again not like this he should go to hell for all i care.she packed all her stuffs and left, leaving everything the office gave her.

Ayat was just came back from salma's place they blocks away from there house and she saw a flashy corrola park at the front of there small house she was surprise because as far as she knows the only people who visit them with cars are mr mehra and its been a while since the last time he came to check on her mum after the accident anf offered her a job at his company,,,,she worked fast because she left ummee alone at the house she jst hop they are fine.she went inside and was hugged by simra she hug her back well simy to what do i hold this visit today she rumple simran's hair aunty ayat zamuyi fada kinsan minti nawa na dauka ina gyara suman nan ayat smiled well that's what you get for not always plating your hair,,,,🙄🙄 pls aunty ayat dont sound like mum....they both laugh.

Ayat smiled and shake her head simran you dont seem to amaze me,,,they sat there gisting and laughing till when the parent came out to leave ayat went to squad to grt mrs mehra bt she hugged her instead ayat its been a long time you dont visit us bt i dont blame you that bossy boss of you is at fault ayat smile and squat to grt mr mehra ayat how have you been am fine sir we were about leaving thinking you will not be back soon since you are here lets go back in i want to talk to you,ayat nodded ok sir,,ayat call me dad am not that old,   they all laugh ummee was the first to go back since she's wheeling her chair first before they all got to enter there tiny leaving room,the only thing there family members left for she and her mum after his death.




Ayat was sitted looking at her mum as she was also on board with such an idea,,ummee in kince inyi irin auren nan wat abt you who is going to be with you,,ummee who was laying close to her daughter draw ayat more close to her,,ayat if its because of me that you asked to think about it first then am telling you,baby girl ayat looked at her mums face,mr mehra has arranged a house help and another nurse plus amina for me,,,,ayat you know i have long to see you get married am not going to allow you let this opportunity pass you,,beside your dad before he died was very fun of asad he was a great kid ayat looked at her mum like she said an abominable thing asad a gr8t human being she nod her head i dought it.....

Ummee was awake all through looking at her daughter she's confident of her daughter doing  what the mehra said but with the way they told her about their son  shes sure her bby is going to be hurt in the process of giving them their son back,beside she feel shes not honest with her girl because this marriage is going to be till eternity but dey are deceiving the children that its only for a while,,,umme rise her hands up God let me not be putting my daughter in harms way,because i cant seem to forget the mehra's help on us when my husband's brother collected everything my husband has leaving us these house only with no food all their friends turn there backs on them except mr mehra he was the only person who help her pay ayat fees all through her academic and was the only helping hand when she got these prblm letting ayat marry there spoiled son is like paying them for all dey did thats the least she could do.she looked at ayat who was smiling in her dreams she smiled too am sorry baby.

He opened the door and ayat was no were to be found he heard a running water in the bathroom,,ughmm🤔 so she do bath,,🤷‍♀well I never new.


Just then ayat came out in a short towel she got in the bathroom,she was aware of asad being in the room but she pretended she didn't,,,she went to her bag pack and brought out all her toiletries she place the one she will need on the table some at the bathroom,,,,asad was shock is this girl for real doesn't she know am in the room why is she showing me her sexy legs and back side in a small you can assume no towel,,,,,ayat came back and sat on the stool she started rubbing her pomade,,asad was just ogling at her body, ,,,

🤔wait o why is he not the one saying she's not sexy.


Ayat did the unthinkable and drop her towel on the ground to rub her lotion there,,,

Asad didn't know when he got up and head to the bathroom,,,the moment his out of her side she laughed asad mehra why didn't you come sit again and tell me am not sexy,,,well I hope you learn what I just taught you,no woman is un sexy most especially to her husband,if he says you ain't sexy make yourself sexy baby,,,she laugh at her last words and tie back her towel to get dress before he comes back and do the same her conciousnes did a backflib ayat that will be tit for tat with the she hurried because she is not ready to have a stroke😂🤩.



Asad let out a sigh what in Gods name just happen is this girl running mad why will she show a grown man such view doesn't she know I can pry on her like a lion...Why would you I thought she is not sexy say's his inner voice.


He look at himself at the mirror of course she is not sexy but a man is a man,,,,,but I will put her in her place the next time she does that he set the shower but was still thinking of ayat homework to him🤪🤪.




Ayat dress in one of the stupid clothe salma got her,,she quote it back to her self to call salma later why will she give her such cloth she can't wear some,,,ayat just wore a short that half of her curve didn't cover with the big sweater asad gave her she head downstairs to see what they got she's starving.



Because its 2 in the morning she didn't get any food in the goldly furnish kitchen everything is set and sparkly,,,she decided to make her self a tea since she saw some bread.


She sat at the table their to eat,,when she was almost finish asad came down to eat too,,,wen she saw him she burst out laughing,,so does eat I thought lions don't eat.


Asad looked at his body annoyed to what is she laughing,,did she see anything wrong with him,,,he look at her in a wired,grumpy and scaring way that she quite herself up before he do something,,,asad being someone who don't let go went close to her collected her tea cup and sip small ayat was just looking at him,,he took the cup away from his mouth and rise it up to her hair and pour the remaining tea on her,,,he look at his handy work and started laughing he laugh hard that he got tears,,,ayat got up but was stopped by him,,he grab her hands really tight and look at her in the eye,,,,ayat asad mehra,,the next time you ogle at me,,just appreciate the looks at get away not laugh like a lunatic🗣 ayat closed her eye he look at her lips and immediately took his eye away and let her go she stumble but luckily for her she didn't fall,,he rise his hands am still the one and only asad don't take my calmness here for granted,,now get away from my site before we both regret what I will do.



ayat ran upstairs all crying because of how asad humiliated her,,,,why didn't you tell him why u were laughing,,,her inner voice said,,to make things worst right well thanks,,she was crying nonstop till she later remember her vow,,,,show asad how important every human being is in life starting from you,,,,she sat down on the bed but how,that was when he came in and got his Mac book and iPad from his bag,,she smiled and got back in bed with a wicked smile,,,asad let's see how clever you are will you let your ego get the Bette of you or will you apologize,she close her eyes and sink in the blanket........



Asad was done checking his emails before he turn to look at the bed ayat was all over it its as if she just did that on purpose,,one of her leg on a pillow while she was hugging one.


🤨🤨how did she expect me to sleep on the bed when she's all over it like a pregnant woman,,,he went close and gave her a spank,,,,auuch she open her eyes to look at him.


Dont auuch me and adjust to the edge of the bed and make sure to not touch me you bull,,ayat didn't say a word but did as he said,,,she was at her back to him,,she smile and whisper asad don't worry tomorrow to give get you deserve you will learn how to say sorry and talk to me nicely.


Asad was just looking at her back till when doze off too.




Ten in the morning ayat wake up again for the second time after subhi and look at asad he hasn't wake talk more of pray,,he was just all sleeping,,,,,

Ayat sigh dont worry salma i can withstand that,,,what i can't withstand is my husband being humiliated....


But!!!!ayat nod please salma dont make me more weak,,,,,,

Asad stare at dad,,,,and recall her words "love have nothing to do with that" he sit up no dad she was just talking in riddle not straight forward....


Do you mean,dad smile and shake his head yes son i think so,,,buh dad 


Son just tell me everything let's see how we can handle it because if its up to me,,i will just go drag her back here because son for one ayat doesn't look anywhere like a gold digger,,even from the first place...as for your mum even from the beginning she's has shown her true colors so the two are not to be compare...



 Asad massage his temple,,staring at dad,,he dont want to give himself false hope....



But he still told dad,,everything including what just happen between them now..

He prays hard to God to please show him a way if its really true that,,something is wrong Ya Allah please show me a sign i dont know where to start from,please God don't let angry cloud my judgment into making a wrong decision please Ya Allah see us through.




He finished his prayer and sit there thinking,,till when he slept off....


Mum came and saw him sleeping she nod,,she went back and bring a blanket she cover him up she look up,,

asad worst he doesn't eat nor drink untill ayat push him hard before he oblige,,in the night she always hear him crying if his not sleeping,,if he is sleeping he will be shouting mum in his dreams,,,hydar on the other hand is taking it a little okay because both mum,simran and dad percify him,,his not hard to convince,,unlike asad who push away everyone except ayat who refuse to let him be,she's always with him,,trying to make him talk......



Three weeks after mum's death,,around ten in the night she comes out to get water for asad which that's what he only take mostly,,her stomach growl reminding her she didn't eat,,so she sat there to look for something to eat,maybe a snacks...

How is he?? she sigh hydar i can't say,,asad is lifeless,he doesn't behave like he wants to live anymore its as if,,,she was trying to make out the word when hydar beat her to it.



As if he has given up on life,,right? She nod yes hydar am confuse i dont know how to help him,,i have allow him grive for long but not anymore,,am now looking for ways to wake him up from this if he is ever going too...


Hydar smile,,,aunty mie the best solution is a vacation here he has memories of her it will not help me to move on now but when he adapt he will only move on remembering her,,remember the trip he said he is planning for the both of you,,,i have finished processing it with the help of dad,,so please take him away for a while,,dont worry about anything just bring back my real brother when you guys are coming back...



Ayat smile,,i will try hydar,,but if i can't i guess my baby here will have to leave the rest of our lives,like that...hydar nod dont worry aunty it will be well just go,,,she smile he look at her plate madam,,you must finish this food oo,,you have grown thin and you are not helping the growth of the baby..she place her hands on her belly,smiling they stayed their gisting till she finished eating.
