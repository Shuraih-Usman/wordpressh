Waye doctor Marwan?

Doctor Marwan d'a ne ga Alhaji Yusuf da Hajiya Maimuna, Alhaji Yusuf is a very wealthy man, he's a retired general who's now into politics, though he's not actively participating in it like before due to age, while Hajiya Maimuna was in the medical field, before she too retired, they are both fulani by tribe, they've been married for over 50 years now, sunada ya'ya biyu, fatima da Marwan, Fatima is their eldest child while Marwan is the youngest, Fatima is happily married to an oil mogul which goes by the name of Alhaji Nasir, Alhaji Nasir is a billionaire, babu wanda bai sanshiba a kasar da ketare, they're blessed with two children, Haseebah da Nadia, Haseebah is 29 years of age and still single, she's a chartered accountant, she's very career driven,and a no-nonsense type of lady, currently bata kasar, tana canada on a course, akwai tazara sosai tsakanin Haseebah da Nadia, cos Nadia is just 23 years old and she studied medicine, she's currently doing her service a hospital din uncle dinta Marwan, Nadia is fair in complexion just like her grandparents, parents and her uncle, she's very fond of her uncle and she's a typical daddy's girl, uban nasonta ba kadan ba, har baya taba ganin laifinta, duk abun datakeso shi take samu, uwarce ma take dan taka mata burki waensu lokutan. Amma one good thing about this family is that upon all this their wealth, basuda wulakanci, they're very nice and welcoming to the poor, even their helps are living comfortably without¬† hitches or any form of discomfort. Nadia is of average height, batada kiba but a very witty lady,akwaita da kafiya akan abu, and she doesn't forgive easily, that's why she doesn't keep friends, the only confidant she has apart from her dad and uncle is one of their help which goes by the name sadiya, tun lokacin da Sadiya tafara aiki a gidansu Nadia, suka kulla kawance, though Sadiya ta girmi Nadia cos ita she's 25 years of age and single.
Marwan is single at 43, cos yayarshi Fatimah is 48 years old, his parents and elder sister sunyi mishi maganar aure har sun gaji sai kawai suka zuba mishi ido, anytime din dasukayi mishi maganar aure his response is always 'when the time is right, he will surely get married', and iyayen shi though they're old but boko yasa their lifestyle is that of 21st century parents, they don't believe in using force on their children for anything, they accord them a certain level of respect, Marwan like i said before has a hospital in Abuja, he has done different courses apart from his Bsc, Masters and Phd, So he's very good at what he does, shiyasa har overseas zuwa yake ya tayasu aiki whenever the need arises, so zamu iya cewa shidin kwararran consultant ne a bangaren zuciya.

"duk suna nan lfy, but on a serious note, i actually miss you, expecially your wittyness" Nadia najin abunda Abnal yafada, her heart almost skipped a bit, but she just have to remind herself to behave, cos she's actually talking to a psychologist here, so he can easily detect her feelings, it's better she should continue with these her witty behaviors , 
"well, let me pity you and say i miss you too, but it's a very tiny little miss oo, so don't go and start feeling yourself" Nadia tafada mishi, Abnal couldn't help it but to start laughing, sannan yace
"is it 'miss' you just performed a surgery on like that?

"let me ask you this, why did you lie to me about not ever having a boyfriend?, i intentionally told you everything about me, cos i don't want any form of secrets between us, yet you decided to lie to me" 
"I'm so sorry for not telling you about ishaq earlier, but i swear it wasn't because of anything, as at the time you asked me about my story life, i didn't think our relationship is gonna work out, hence i didn't see the need to tell you about him" laila tafada mishi

"sweetheart i made you cry, i dont think any words will be enough to quantify how sorry I am right now, i never in my entire life wish to hurt you in anyway, I'm soo sorry for making you feel this way, i promise you it wasn't intentional, and for the record, i have never seen you as the materialistic type, infact to show you how sorry I am, let's just forget everything about your ex, he was in your past which doesn't really matter, what i really care about is your present and future" Marwan yafada mata cikin ra'da, laila bata ce komai ba, Marwan ne ya kuma cewa

"you have absolutely nothing to worry about even if I'm surrounded by thousands of men, my heart has already been stolen by you, so it now belongs to you and you alone" laila tafada mishi seductively, shiru Marwan yayi while allowing what she just said now sink, sannan yace
"the only thing saving you from me right now is the fact that you're not beside me" dariya laila tayi tana cewa
"and what would you have done if I was beside you ?" she asked him in a whisper
"don't worry about what i would have done, cos saying it would never be like experimenting it, so duk ranar da muka hadu zaki sani" Marwan ya amsata, haka suka cigaba da hiran soyayya, daga baya Marwan ya fadawa laila cewa ta gayawa Abnal yaje ya dauki passport wanda za'ayi amfani dashi wajen yimishi international passport da sauran documents din da ake bukata, godiya da adduoi laila tayi mishi sosai, sai wajajen 4am suka kwanta bacci.

"maganarka gaskiya ne, but thanks to God and Mami for the type of orientation and upbringing she gave us, some or most parents are the ones that mislead their children, my reasons for saying this are as follow, na farko, immediately children hits puberty age expecially the females za kaga cewa iyaye zasu fara cewa they shouldn't allow the opposite sex come close to them or touch them, if they do and eventually they loose their virginity, toh mijin dazasu aura ba zai daraja suba and stuff like that, which is a wrong advice/training or orientation, the correct thing to say and inbibe in our children is, they shouldn't go close or commit ZINA because Almighty Allah has FORBIDDEN IT and its HARAM, not because of a Man, the second reason should be because of their selves, their body is their own expecially their private parts, it's called 'private' for a reason, we shouldn't make a girl's life to be all about a man, i know of soo many ladies that didn't marry as a virgin and their husband adores and cherish them, while some marry as a virgin and mijinsu bai san darajar suba, wulakancin yau daban na gobe daban, so kaga cewa that ideology of 'in mijinki bai sameki da budurcinki zai wulakanta ki' is not completely true, shiyasa zakiga maza na iya yaudaran ya'n mata by promising them marriage in exchange for their virginity, in ba'a samu sa'aba sai kiga itama ta bada jikinta, afterall the main reason she was told to keep her virginity is because of her husband, and the guy has promised her marriage, forgetting that Almighty Allah has forbidden it, and mostly ba laifinsu baneba, Abunda iyayenta suka gayamata ne, for example now, had it been you didn't find me a virgin would you have been disappointed? " laila ta tambayeshi
" not really, cos i never really expected that i will be marrying a virgin, afterall I'm not one" Marwan replied 
"my point exactly! See why we need to stop making a girl's life all about a man, and we should also stop giving our male children preferential treatments, and stop that 'duk abunda namiji yayi ado ne', let's give our children equal training, yanda zamu sawa mace ido cikin tarbiyanta same should apply for the male, let me give another example, please don't take what i want to say the wrong way, but had it been i was the one that have slept with different men just the way you did, lokacin daka zo neman aure na da mutane sunyi discouraging dinka forgetting the fact that i have stopped and I'm now a changed person, zasuce ai 'karuwa ce' so karka aureta, Amma dayake kai namiji ne society will not see anything wrong with that, like the saying goes 'we're in a man' s world ', which is not supposed to be, kar incika ka da surutu, buh parents really needs tobe intentional when it comes to children training and we should endeavor to learn what parenting is all about afterall nobody was born with the knowledge" laila ta karasa fada tana murmushi, tsaya kallonta Marwan yayi daga baya yace
"I'm speechless, i don't even know what to say, you just blew me away with this knowledge you just impacted in me" Marwan yafada yana pecking din bakinta

"and why will i promise you such? It's not as if we are an item" Nadia tafada while smiling 
"I'm serious here, please just promise me" Abnal ya kuma fada mata while still staring deeply at her
"see me see trouble oo, irin wannan karfin hali, okay i promise you" Nadia tafada cos the way Abnal is staring at her is making her feel uncomfortable 
"thank you" Abnal replied,
"so when will you be visiting sis hassy cos she's through with her exams?" Nadia ta tambayeshi trying to change the topic 
"truly i don't know, cos i got a job in a consulting agency as a therapist, so my free time is quit limited, but muhseen will be going to see her tomorrow" Abnal¬† replied 
"wow congrats, shine ko ka gayamun, had it been i did not ask you about sis hassy you wouldn't have said a word" Nadia tafada a shagwabe
"you know that's not true, that was the main reason i called you, but i got distracted when you asked about the pictures you sent me, in ban gaya miki ba wazan gayawa kuma?" Abnal yafada mata jokingly 
"i don hear, so your therapy is for who?" Nadia asked 
"people with depression, any form or type of depression" Abnal replied 
"nice one and good luck with that" Nadia tafada
"thanks, but i will try and squeeze out time to go see haseeba, duk lokacin dazan je i will let you know" Abnal yafada mata. 

Lokacin bikin Mami da Alhaji Habib, Both muhseen da Abnal were super excited, yanzu they call themselves brothers, saiga Yusuf Shima yana gayawa muhseen cewa shi yasamu mata which is sameera, da Abnal yaji wannan kuma he was speechless, cos everything was just happening soo fast, if anyone had told him 6 months back that he and his family will be where they are today zai karyata ne, Amma sai gashi within a blink of an eye Almighty Allah has turned their life around, bai da abun cewa sai Alhamdulillah (that's Almighty Allah for you), followed by lailas pregnancy, the day he heard that one, sai dayayi kwalla cos of how overwhelmed he was with soo many emotions.

"you don't have to rub it in my face, i know she's more beautiful than me" Nadia tafada jealously, gashi dama bata gama hucewa ba da maganar maria da haseeba ta fada mata, Abnal was quick to detect the jealousy in Nadia's voice, sai yace
"c'mon, you know i was joking" 
"don't try to deceive me, the truth is out there in the open" Nadia tafada sounding upset 
"haven't you heard the saying 'beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder'? So you're more beautiful than her to me" Abnal yafada trying to calm Nadia down 
"kai kasan da wannan, me i want to sleep" Nadia replied while still sounding upset 
"you still upset, yanzu ba daman inyi wasa dake?" Abnal ya tambayeta a hankali
"why won't i be? And maganar wasa kuma, if the only play you know how to do is by comparing me to others, please don't play or joke with me again, goodnight!" Nadia tafada tareda katse kiran, Abnal was just speechless cos harga Allah shi baiga abun fushi anan ba, Amma one thing daya sani for sure is that Nadia has insecurity issues and her jealousy is something else, he already knows that Nadia likes him and he won't lie to himself he knows he's in love with her too, dukda that wasn't his plan, infact shima baisan lokacin daya fada kogin sontaba, Abnal bai kuma kiran taba cos he knows if he does, it won't end well and shi ba mai son hayaniya baneba, so he just let her be for tonight, maybe if she sleeps over her anger she will feel better, gobe in Allah ya yarda sai ya kirata. 

Throughout that night Nadia wasn't herself, baccinma bai zoba cos of how disturbed she was, she knew she shouldn't have blew things out of proportion the way she did, but she let her jealousy got the best of her. Washegari da safe, da sadiya tazo gyara dakinta taga cewa Nadia looks sad, sai ta tambayeta what the problem was, Nadia bata boye mata komai ba, sai data gama fadawa Sadiya incident din daya faru jiya, sadiya tace
"that outburst of yours wasn't necessary, from all indications the compliment he gave sister haseeba was a harmless one, and it might be cewa tsokanarki yake, now you've allowed your jealousy to get the best of you" 
"i know i messed up, what's the way out now?" Nadia tafada sounding desperate 
"you really need to put your emotions in check, cos remember he hasn't asked you out yet, we're just guessing cewa him too might be in love with you due to his recent behaviors, but if you continue with this your unnecessary jealousy, zai iya hakura dake, afterall he's yet to ask you out, yanzu abun daza muyi shine, you will draft an apology text and send to him , then later sai ki kirashi ki kuma bashi hakuri, tunda you were the one that hang the call on him yesterday" sadiya tafada mata
"okay i will do as you say, thank you soo much" Nadia tafada tana hugging din sadiya, murmushi sadiya tayi sannan tace
"don't hug me yet cos we don't know if he will forgive you easily, dan gaskiya most people expecially guys don't like it when someone hangs the call on them" 
"in Shaa Allah he will forgive me, he's a nice guy with a cool temper" Nadia tafada while smiling 
"i see, that's why you want to take his niceness for granted abi? Well kiyi a hankali dan wallahi irinsu their anger is not always good" sadiya warned her, Sadiya na fita daga dakin Nadia tadau wayarta ta turawa Abnal an apology text sannan ta tashi tashiga ban daki. Lokacinda Sakon ya shigo wayar Abnal yana Sallar Fajr ne, sai daya idar ya dauki wayar ya bude Sakon, kawai murmushi yayi tareda fara kiranta, Nadia najin wayarta ya fara ringing tafito da sauri cos she was suspecting cewa it might be Abnal calling her, aikam tana zuwa taga cewa shine, dagawa tayi da sauri dan kiran ya kusan katsewa tana cewa
"hello, good morning" 
"morning, how was your night?" Abnal ya tambayeta
"Alhamdulillah, it was good, and yours?" 
"to be sincere mine wasn't that great" Abnal replied her
"and why is that?" Nadia ta kuma tambayarshi
"are you seriously asking me that question?" Abnal asked her back
"I'm sorry if it's because of what happened yesterday, i let my emotions got the best of me" Nadia replied pleasingly
"don't do that again, you ought to know by now that i will never intentionally provoke or hurt you, and if by chance i do, you can always tell me politely, you don't have to go haywire and even go to the extent of hanging up on me, that's not cool" Abnal reprimanded her
"i know that i messed up, but just forgive me please, and i promise not to hang up on you again" Nadia pleaded 
"I'm not upset with you, if i was i wouldn't have called you" Abnal yafada mata calmly 
"thank you soo much, so what's your plan for today?" Nadia ta tambayeshi trying to change the topic 
"my schedule today is a bit tight, cos i have lectures and after that i have some sessions with three of my patients, but i will give you a call as soon as I'm free" Abnal yayi mata bayani
"okay, even me i will be busy throughout today, but i will be expecting your call later" Nadia tafada mishi
"okay, later then, and take care of yourself" Abnal yafada
"i will, you too" Nadia replied back, sannan suka katse kiran, ai Nadia na ajiye wayar ta kira sadiya tareda gaya mata komai, murna ta tayata amma ta kuma warning dinta cewa she should be careful and¬† should also remember that he is yet to ask her out. 
Bayan Abnal ya gama shiryawa yafito saiga muhseen Shima ya fito daga nashi apartment din, gaisawa sukayi sannan muhseen yace 
"so hope you enjoyed yourself yesterday?" 
"yes i did, haseeba is such a nice lady, i like her vibe" Abnal replied 
"yeah she is, but hope you're not trying to woo her cos she's taken" muhseen yafada, dariya Abnal yayi sannan yace 
"don't worry man, the compliment was a harmless one, by the way, what's up with the both of you? I saw the way you were staring at her yesterday" 
"for now nothing, you know we dated before, and now i want us to get back together but she's proving stubborn" muhseen yafada yana bude kofar motarshi
"and why is that?" Abnal ya tambayeshi shima yana bude nashi gefen motar
"because we're age mates, gani take I'm too small for her" muhseen ya amsa shi tareda kunna motar suka bar gidan 
"wow, but age is nothing if there's love" Abnal yafada
"maybe you should tell her that cos i know that she still has feelings for me" muhseen replied 
"if you're sure that she still has feelings for you, maybe you should put more pressure" 
"i will, but kaima kasamun baki, cos i noticed cewa she holds you in high esteem" muhseen said, murmushi Abnal yayi sannan yace
"which kind high esteem she hold me?, kawai kace kanason insa maka baki, but no bobo mi please" 
"well i know what I'm saying, enough about me, how far you and Nadia?" Muhseen ya tamabyeshi
"what about us?" Abnal shima ya mayar mishi da tambaya
"bro i know you like that girl, so quite the pretense please" muhseen ya amsa shi
"nidai bance maka komai ba" Abnal yafada
"ai basai kacemun komai ba, your actions alone has said it all, i don't know why you don't want to disclose your feelings with me, kodai har yanzu baka daukeni a matsayin dan uwanka bane ba shiyasa" muhseen yafada
"you don't have to emotionally blackmail me into telling you what you want to hear, cos kasan cewa you're not like a brother to me but rather you're one, but sincerely there's nothing between me and Nadia for now" Abnal explaied
"but you like her, cos if you don't you wouldn't have used her pic as your phones wallpaper" muhseen yafada yana murmushi, Abnal bai bashi amsa ba instead murmusawa kawai yayi. 

Tun lokacin da maria taga Abnal ta addabi haseeba cewa dan Allah ta taimaka mata ta hadasu cos she likes him, amma haseeba was having none of it, dan cewa maria tayi that Abnal is already in a relationship with her sister, dan ta kudirta cewa zata hada Abnal da Nadia, cos Abnal seems to be a very humble and nice guy. Da maria taga cewa dagaske haseeba take, she's not ready to help her sai tafara neman hanyar dazata dauki digits din Abnal daga wayar haseeba, dan harga Allah Maria really likes Abnal, it was a love at first sight for her. 
Haseeba ta kusan komawa Nigeria cos ta gama program din datazo yi, kawai result dinta take jira, so gobe haseeba da maria sukayi cewa they would pay Abnal and muhseen a visit tunda su sunzo nasu gidan.

"okay, how may we entertain you ladies?" 
"we should just order Chinese, or what do you think?" muhseen yafada yana kallon haseeba 
"actually, i plan on cooking for you ladies but if you prefer us to order no problem" Abnal ya fada musu, aikam haseeba najin abunda Abnal yafada sai tace

"okay, so how about what we discussed?, I'm still waiting for your positive reply" muhseen ya kuma fada mata, fuskantar shi haseeba tayi sannan tace
"for the tenth thousandth times, muhseen the only relationship that can exist between the two of us is that of friendship, I'm too mature for you, what am i even saying? We're age mates for crying out loud!, so just quite this love thingy you're going on all about" all this while da haseeba take magana, muhseen was just staring at her and smiling, bayan haseeba ta gama magana sai Maria dake kallonsu while smiling also tace
"muhseen don't mind her, the feelings between the both of you is mutual, she's just playing hard to get", fuskantarta haseeba tayi sannan tace

"you better stop running away from the truth" haseeba bata amsa shiba ta shiga kitchen taje tasamu Abnal. 

Abnal was chopping tomatoes when haseeba entered the kitchen, sannu da aiki haseeba tayi mishi sannan tace
"why not blend the tomatoes instead of chopping them?" 
"i prefer the chopped ones" Abnal replied 
"wow, kace kanwata nada aiki agabanta" haseeba tafada wanting to hear what Abnal will say, kallonta Abnal yayi yana murmushi yace
"and who told you that I'm in a relationship with your sister?" 
"actually nobody did, i just guessed, so you tell me, did i guess right or wrong?" haseeba ta kuma fada 
"why don't you just come out clean and ask me straight forward, instead of trying to trick me into telling you" Abnal ya fada mata while still smiling 
" for a minute i forgot that I'm actually talking to a psychologist, so since you already figured me out, why not do the honor and just tell me what you already know that i want to hear?" haseeba ta kuma tambayarshi, dariya Abnal yayi sannan yace 
"i like the fact that you came out clean, but to be honest with you, i and your sister are not in a relationship, we're just friends" Abnal ya amsata
"but you like her?" haseeba asked again 
"gosh! You're soo inquisitive" Abnal replied 
"agreed, i am, just answer my question already" haseeba ta kuma fada
"okay, if i tell you, do you promise not to tell her anything we discuss here?" Abnal asked
"i promise" haseeba replied while putting her hand on her chest, ajiye wukar dake hannunshi Abnal yayi sannan ya fuskanci haseeba sosai yace
"i don't like her but rather i love her, though i haven't told her yet, so please let this be our little secret" 
"awwwn, i love this confession, so touchy, but if i may ask again, why don't you want to tell her about your feelings? Ain't you scared that she might fall in love with another, tunda bata san cewa you love her ba" haseeba ta fada mishi, wani irin confident murmushi Abnal yayi sannan yace 
"that won't happen cos she fell in love with me before i did with her" 
"she told you that?" haseeba asked surprised, cos she remember Nadia telling her that ita bata gaya mishi komai ba, and she knows that Nadia can be many things but one thing datasan cewa Nadia batayi is lying and pretending, these two things bata iya suba
"nope she didn't, but her action did, though she really tried in hiding it, but you must know already know that your sister is not good at pretending, so at a point her actions gave her away" Abnal replied 
"that's true, you've really studied her well, let me ask you one last question,when are you planning on telling her about your feelings for her?" haseeba ta kuma tambayarshi, cos harga Allah she doesn't want Nadia to miss on this opportunity dan Abnal is a full package, and from the look of things yanada hakuri sosai, that's the kind of man Nadia needs, someone that can over look her shortcomings, cos she has a lot of them
"until I'm back in Nigeria before i tell her, reason because Nadia has insecurity issues, indai i formalize our relationship here, matsala zamu ringa samu because she won't want any other lady around me, so she needs to understand me more, cos i understand her already, before we proceed further " Abnal explained
" all what you just said are true, but i believe with love you both can overcome anything" haseeba replied
"true, enough about me, how about you and muhseen, what's happening between the both of you? " Abnal ya tambayeta , yana rufe bakinshi saiga muhseen da maria nan suma sun shigo, sai muhseen yace
"thanks bro, help me ask her very well" 
"i don't understand why ya'all are implying that there's something going on between me and him" haseeba tafada
"that's simply because the chemistry between us is very strong" muhseen yafada¬† tareda tsayawa agaban haseeba, ajiye cokali dake hannunshi Abnal yayi tareda fuskantar haseeba yace
"okay tell me why you don't wanna date him" 
"cos we're age mates for crying out loud! Agreed we once dated when we were in high school, but we were young then, now its totally different, i for one wants to settle down, I'm past that boyfriend and girlfriend stage, to cut the long story short, i don't see a future for the both of us" haseeba explained 
"but i see, cos from your explanation the only excuse you gave was that of your age, which means you like him too but because of your age kina ganin cewa you're too big for him, but let me tell you this, when there's love, age will be nothing but numbers" Abnal yafadawa haseeba 
"i cant believe you're supporting him" haseeba said
"believe me I'm not, I'm just being honest here" Abnal replied 
"thanks bro for enlightening her, atleast she should give US a chance, if at all it doesn't work out, i promise i will let her be, but taki ta yarda" muhseen yafada
"thats because she knows it's gonna work out, she's just scared which is very unlike her, the haseeba i know is a fearless woman who's ready to take on the world" Maria tafadawa muhseen 
"wato so kuke ku hada mun kai, but before that happens let me leave the kitchen for you guys again" haseeba tafada tana barin kitchen din.

"whatever you want to say, better say it here cos I'm not going anywhere with you" haseeba replied 
"what are you scared of?" Abnal ya tambayeta yana murmushi 
"she's scared of being alone with him, she doesn't trust herself" Maria ta amsa Abnal while smiling and looking at haseeba 
"me scared of muhseen? Allah ya kiyaye" haseeba tafada
"okay indai kinsan you're not scared of being alone with him, follow him" Maria ta kuma fada
"are you daring me?" haseeba asked 
"yes, its a dare" Maria replied 
"you know i will surely avenge all these things that you're doing ba?" haseeba tafadawa Maria, Maria bata amsa taba instead sai dariya take mata, Abnal ne yayi magana yace
"why you dey fall my hand like this, go with him i promise he won't bite" yafada yana dariya, All the while dasuke wannan back and forth tsakaninsu, muhseen was just smiling and still standing with his hand stretched towards haseeba to take

*_***SNEAK PEAK FROM MY NEXT BOOK 'QADDARAR JEDDERH' (JEDDERH'S DESTINY). 

"... I'm gonna ask you a simple question that needs a yes or no answer, have you slept with that man that you were with?" Sadiq asked her in a very calm tone, Amma kallo daya mutum zaiyi mishi yasan cewa this his calmness is nothing but what we call 'the calm before the storm', murmushin takaici Jedderh tayi sannan tace
" you must be a joker, i will pretend that you didn't just ask me that pervatic question, just move out of my way and let me go if at all you want me to forgive this stunt you just pulled on me now" Jedderh tafada mishi cos Sadiq was standing between her and the door, babu yanda zata fita if at all Sadiq bai matsa daga hanyar taba
"answer the damn question!!!" Sadiq yafada cikin fushi, cos just the thought that there's a possibility nacewa Jedderh has been intimate with Mr Johnson is driving him nuts, Jedderh was shocked and also taken a back by yanda Sadiq yayi ihu cos she wasn't expecting it, batasan lokacin data amsashi da 
"no i haven't slept with him, I'm just his date and nothing more" tafada while giving him a surprised look, Sadiq najin amsa dinta baisan lokacin dayayi ajiyan zuciya ba yana shafa fuskarshi frustratingly, Jedderh was just staring at him speechless cos she simply do not understand what's going on in Sadiq's head
"now that I've answered your pervatic question you should let me out, else you give me no option than to call anty maggy and explain all what you did to her, I'm sure you wouldn't want a lawsuit in your hand anytime soon" Jedderh threatened him confidently, cos she has decided not to show an iota of fear, Da Sadiq yaji abun da Jedderh tafada sai ya ciro wayarshi tareda fara dannawa cos he knows what Jedderh said is true, anty maggy doesn't play with any of her girls, any form of maltreatment she will sue you, and the last thing Sadiq wants is a lawsuit on his office deck all because of an excort, so he decided to beat Jedderh to her own game by calling anty maggy himself, dan yanada number dinta awayarshi amma this is the first time dazai kirata da kanshi, harun has always been the one to do the calling, wayar nafara ringing Sadiq yasashi a handsfree, Jedderh was just standing there wondering who he was calling, not until taji muryar anty maggy ta daga wayar tana cewa 
"hello, good evening Sir" cos anty maggy has Sadiq's digits, and when she saw his call she was soo excited amma kuma tana dan fargaba cewa hope Sadiq is not calling to stop his patronage cos the last set of girls daya aika mishi he declined all of them, and¬† each one of those ladies were anty maggy's best, so she's worried cewa Sadiq is not finding her services worthy anymore and she wouldn't want to loose him as a client 
"so i will assume that you know who's on the line" Sadiq yafada mata
"yes sir, i do" anty maggy replied respectfully 
"okay, in that case let me go straight to the reason why I called you, i want the lady you sent to Mr Johnson to spend a month with me" Sadiq yafada authoritatively, cos he has decided to have Jedderh to his fill and a month should be okay for him, cos he really needs to get his sanity back, Jedderh najin abunda Sadiq yafada ta bude duk idanuwanta waje finding it hard to believe what she just heard him say, Amma she decided to keep mute and hear anty maggy's response first, 
"oh you mean Jedderh right?" anty maggy ta tambayeshi 
"i don't know whatever her name is" Sadiq replied arrogantly, Jedderh was just staring at him 
"that's her name sir, that shouldn't be a problem at all, buh it will cost you alot of money..." anty maggy tafara fada cos she really don't want to turn Sadiq's offer down after not being able to satisfy him for weeks, and again this is a very good business that will fetch her alot of money, katseta Sadiq yayi ta hanyar cewa
" that shouldn't be a problem, get your lawyers to meet mine and they both can settle things out, you just name your price" Sadiq yafada 
"okay sir, in that case she's all yours for the next one month" anty maggy tafada excitedly kafun Sadiq ya katse kiran yana bawa Jedderh kallon 'you're all mine now'. 
Jedderh couldn't believe cewa anty maggy just accepted Sadiq's demand just like that without asking her first, sai yanzu ta kuma sanin cewa batada gata, but God knows she's not spending a month with this egoistic bastard, tana gama wannan tunanin wayarta yafara ringing, tana dauka taga cewa anty maggy ce, dagawa tayi bayan sun gaisa anty maggy tayi mata bayanin proposal din Sadiq, there and then Jedderh tayi rejecting dinshi, sai anty maggy tace
"you don't get to reject a client, don't you want more money? If you don't need or want money, well i do, so you better make use of this opportunity that you have and secure your future, remember you're indebted and binded to the agency for the next five years, if you really do not want to stay with him for a month, then pay me the exact amount he's paying for your services" 
"anty maggy you of all people knows that i don't have the money to pay you..." Jedderh tafada pleadinly 
"in that case, you'll stay with him for a month and certisfy him in every possible way you can and i don't want any complaints from him about you, so you better behave yourself and be on your best behavior, good luck to you" anty maggy na gama fadan haka ta katse kiran. Jedderh was left dumbfounded, juyowa tayi ta fuskanceshi tace
"you this Sadistic bastard, you think you can buy me with your money, well I'm not for sell! So you better call anty maggy back and tell her that you're no longer interested in me, else you won't like what i have up my sleeve for you" Jedderh tafada mishi angrily thinking that her rude behavior might change Sadiq's mind, takawa zuwa gabanta Sadiq yayi while staring down at her yafara cewa
"you're nobody to tell me what to do or not to do, you're just a mere cheap whore that's needed to be taught a lesson cos you're rude, and don't think that this one month you're about to spend with me is gonna be an enjoyable one, no, far from it, it's gonna be hell on earth cos I'm gonna be having you my way, anyhow i want it you have no choice than to give it to me, you know why? Cos you're for sale and I've paid for a month out of your miserable life, so the earlier you shut that latrine you call a mouth the better for you", Sadiq na gama fadan haka sai ya juya yafita daga dakin tareda kulle Jedderh aciki.

Anty faty ta fadawa Alhaji Nasir batun tafiyan da haseeba take sonyi, Alhaji Nasir was a bit hesitant at first, saying that it's barely a year dawowarta daga Canada, Amma anty faty persuaded him to let her, highest this would be her last traveling, that if they say she shouldn't go it will be as if its because of Nadia that's engaged, tunda basu ta'ba hanataba before, da haka anty faty ta shawo kan Alhaji Nasir.

So what did you want to discuss that was soo urgent?" muhseen ya kuma tambayarta, kurama juna ido sukayi nadan wani lokaci cos she knows what she's about to say might make or break their relationship, but to God who made her she can't abandon her career because of a man, she loves it too much, numfasawa haseeba tayi sannan tace
"I'm traveling to Dublin on a course", muhseen najin abun data fada countenance dinshi ya changa, immediately ya tashi tsaye yana cewa

I'm career driven and oriented, i love what I do and I want to be the best at it, if you're looking for a sit at home wife, or a wife that will be available at all time then sweety I'm not the woman for you, cos not even marriage will stop me from traveling if the need arises, so wallahi kaji na rantse maka i will understand if you quit the relationship now cos is not all men that will tolerate such, infact only few men will, so it's not too late to say no, this is part of the reason why i didn't want us to make our relationship public so you won't be obligated to go on with it when you can't cope..." katseta muhseen yayi ta hanyar cewa
" enough haseeba, you know perfectly well how crazy i am about you, i understand and i knew right from onset that you're very passionate about your career which i respect soo much, but all I'm saying is kiyarda inturo ayi maganar aurenmu, yesterday night when Abnal came back and told all of us about his proposal to Nadia, we were all excited that dad was even sujesting cewa why not a hada aurensu dana ya Yusuf since sameera is through with her final exams, service kawai ne ya rage mata, which zata iyayi a gidan miji, and i was thinking cewa maybe na mu uku za'a hada, but hearing you say this now just shatters my hope and plan"
"babe i swear i understand and feel your pain, and the only reason I'm going on this course is because of the promotion involved, and it's just a 2 months course so kaga cewa ba wani dadewa zanyiba, infact have it in mind cewa tare dasu Nadia za'ayi bikinmu, na riga na gayawa anty faty about you amma batasan cewa kaine ba, i just told her i already have a fianc√©, so ina dawowa zan gaya mata cewa kai ne, i know that she will start preparing for our wedding before my arrival, so ka kwantar da hankalin ka, before you know it two months will be gone" haseeba tafada tana marairace fuska da shafa fuskar muhseen, cos deep down she loves him and will not want to loose him, kura mata ido muhseen yayi nadan lokaci sannan yace

"what is it again?" muhseen asked while starring at her as if his world revolves around her
"you know mutane zasuyi magana cewa me and you are age mates or I'm too old for you etc, nasan bazaka samu matsala daga wajen dad dinkaba but the rest of the family members will surely and definitely talk" haseeba tafada mishi worriedly, matsa kusa da ita sosai muhseen yayi ya rike gefen fuskarta sannan yace
"i don't care what people say, nice zan aureki so your focus and concern should be about me, people will always talk, so please don't let or disturb yourself about people's opinion, what's important is the love we have and feel for each other"
"thanks for your understanding, i love you" haseeba tafada mishi tareda pecking din bakinshi, haseeba didn't stay long before leaving.

"can you imagine the audacity of this girl?, telling me that the reason behind my refusal to meet with her is because i still have feelings for her" Abnal yafada yana kallon muhseen

"yes she's the one, i don't know what to do with her again, if i block her number she gets new one, duk tabi ta addabeni" Abnal replied him exasperatedly, murmushi muhseen yayi sannan yace
"let me tell you something, you need to meet with her and talk face to face, she needs to see for herself that you're truly over her, you both need closure cos you never had it, inba haka kayiba she will continue to pester you, and blocking her number is not gonna work cos she will most definitely get a new one, so just set a date for her, ku biyu ku zauna ku tattauna, make her realize that no any hard feelings, but you're over her, if not she might end up causing problems between you and Nady" Muhseen yafada mishi
"she already has caused a problem between us before which i don't want a repetition, i think i will just take your advice, set a date with her and get this over with" Abnal yafada yana duba wayarshi
"but the earlier you see her the better, cause that girl is like a cancer which you won't want it to spread, so the earlier you cut her off the better for you" muhseen ya kuma jadadda mishi

"dukda haka, your situation is still better than mine" muhseen insisted
"i hear you, but c'mon cheer up before you know it two months will pass by and your girl will be back" Abnal yafada cheerfully trying to cheer muhseen up.

***SNEAK PEAK FROM MY NEXT BOOK 'QADDARAR JEDDERH' JEDDERH'S DESTINY '




"I'm gonna ask you a simple question that needs a yes or no answer, have you slept with that man that you were with?" Sadiq asked her in a very calm tone, Amma kallo daya mutum zaiyi mishi yasan cewa this his calmness is nothing but what we call 'calm before the storm', murmushin takaici Jedderh tayi sannan tace
" you must be a joker, i will pretend that you didn't just ask me that pervatic question, just move out of my way and let me go if at all you want me to forgive this stunt you pulled on me now" Jedderh tafada mishi cos Sadiq was standing between her and the door, babu yanda zata fita if at all Sadiq bai matsa daga hanyar taba
"answer the damn question!!!" Sadiq yafada cikin fushi, cos just the thought that there's a possibility nacewa Jedderh has been intimate with Mr Johnson is driving him nuts, Jedderh was shocked and taken a back by yanda Sadiq yayi ihu cos she wasn't expecting it, batasan lokacin data amsashi da 
"no i haven't slept with him, I'm just his date and nothing more" tafada while giving him a surprised look, Sadiq najin amsa dinta baisan lokacin dayayi ajiyan zuciya ba yana shafa fuskarshi frustratingly, Jedderh was just staring at him speechless cos she simply do not understand what's going on in Sadiq's head
"now that I've answered your question you should let me out, else you give me no option than to call anty maggy and explain all what you did to her, I'm sure you wouldn't want a lawsuit in your hand anytime soon" Jedderh tafada mishi confidently cos she has decided not to show an iota of fear, Da Sadiq yaji abun da Jedderh tafada sai ya ciro wayarshi tareda fara dannawa cos he knows what Jedderh said is true, anty maggy doesn't play with any of her girls, any form of maltreatment she will sue you, and the last thing Sadiq wants is a lawsuit on his office deck all because of an excort, so he decided to beat Jedderh to her own game by calling anty maggy himself, dan yanada number dinta awayarshi amma this is the first time dazai kirata da kanshi, harun has always been the one to do the calling, wayar nafara ringing Sadiq yasashi a handsfree, Jedderh was just standing there wondering who he was calling, not until taji muryar anty maggy ta daga wayar tana cewa 
"hello, good evening Sir" cos anty maggy has Sadiq's digits, and when she saw his call she was soo excited amma kuma tana dan fargaba cewa hope Sadiq is not calling to stop his patronage cos the last set of girls daya aika mishi he declined all of them, and¬† each one of those ladies were anty maggy's best, so she's worried cewa Sadiq is not finding her services worthy anymore and she wouldn't want to loose him as a client 
"so i will assume that you know who's on the line" Sadiq yafada mata
"yes sir, i do" anty maggy replied respectfully 
"okay, in that case let me go straight to the reason why I called you, i want the lady you sent to Mr Johnson to spend a month with me" Sadiq yafada authoritatively, cos he has decided to have Jedderh to his fill and a month should be okay for him, cos he really needs to get his sanity back, Jedderh najin abunda Sadiq yafada ta bude duk idanuwanta waje finding it hard to believe what she just heard him say, Amma she decided to keep mute and hear anty maggy's response first, 
"oh you mean Jedderh right?" anty maggy ta tambayeshi 
"i don't know whatever her name is" Sadiq replied arrogantly, Jedderh was just staring at him 
"that's her name sir, that shouldn't be a problem at all, buh it will cost you alot of money..." anty maggy tafara fada cos she really don't want to turn Sadiq's offer down after not being able to satisfy him for weeks, and again this is a very good business that will fetch her alot of money, katseta Sadiq yayi ta hanyar cewa
" that shouldn't be a problem, get your lawyers to meet mine and they both can settle things out, you just name your price" Sadiq yafada 
"okay sir, in that case she's all yours for the next one month" anty maggy tafada excitedly kafun Sadiq ya katse kiran yana bawa Jedderh kallon 'you're all mine now'. 
Jedderh couldn't believe cewa anty maggy just accepted Sadiq's demand just like that without asking her first, sai yanzu ta kuma sanin cewa batada gata, but God knows she's not spending a month with this egoistic bastard, tana gama wannan tunanin wayarta yafara ringing, tana dauka taga cewa anty maggy ce, dagawa tayi bayan sun gaisa anty maggy tayi mata bayanin proposal din Sadiq, there and then Jedderh tayi rejecting dinshi, sai anty maggy tace
"you don't get to reject a client, don't you want more money? If you don't need or want money, well i do, so you better make use of this opportunity that you have and secure your future, remember you're indebted and binded to the agency for the next five years, if you really do not want to stay with him for a month, then pay me the exact amount he's paying for your services" 
"anty maggy you of all people knows that i don't have the money to pay you..." Jedderh tafada pleadinly 
"in that case, you'll stay with him for a month and certisfy him in every possible way you can and i don't want any complaints from him about you, so you better behave yourself and be on your best behavior, good luck to you" anty maggy na gama fadan haka ta katse kiran. Jedderh was left dumbfounded, juyowa tayi ta fuskanceshi tace
"you this Sadistic bastard, you think you can buy me with your money, well I'm not for sell! So you better call anty maggy back and tell her that you're no longer interested in me, else you won't like what i have up my sleeve for you" Jedderh tafada mishi angrily thinking that her rude behavior might change Sadiq's mind, takawa zuwa gabanta Sadiq yayi while staring down at her yafara cewa
"you're nobody to tell me what to do or not to do, you're just a mere cheap whore that's needed to be taught a lesson cos you're rude, and don't think that this one month you're about to spend with me is gonna be an enjoyable one, no, far from it, it's gonna be hell on earth cos I'm gonna be having you my way, anyhow i want it you have no choice than to give it to me, you know why? Cos you're for sale and I've paid for a month out of your miserable life, so the earlier you shut that latrine you call a mouth the better for you", Sadiq na gama fadan haka sai ya juya yafita daga dakin tareda kulle Jedderh aciki.

Meanwhile patient dinda suka yiwa aiki jiya had an episode in the night that they had to call Marwan, cikin daren Marwan yazo asabiti, bayan yayi stabilizing din patient din ya gwada layin Nadia dan ya gaya mata cewa she should come to the hospital earlier than they discussed buh her number was switched off, he had to call anty faty, bayan anty faty ta daga wayar suka gama gaisawa sai Marwan yake ce mata dan Allah ta tayashi gayawa Nadia cewa she should come to work earlier than they discussed, sai anty faty ta amsa mishi da cewa ai Nadia batazo gida ba, a asabiti ta kwana, and she went ahead to aske Marwan inda shi yake, Marwan was surprised by his sister's response, immediately yasan cewa something fishy is going on, sai ya amsata da cewa shi yana gida, Amma yanxu shi zai tafi asabiti, 'okay toh shikenan, Allah ya taimaka' anty faty tafada kafun sukayiwa juna sallama. After dropping the call anty faty bata kawo anty suspicious zuwa rantaba cos Nadia has always been a very well behaved girl, so maganar cewa maybe she went somewhere baizo mataba. On the other hand Marwan was confused as to what exactly is happening, tashi yayi daga office dinshi ya koma zama a compound din asabitin yana fuskantar gate din asabitin, ko minti ashirin Marwan baiyi da zama ba saiga motar Nadia nan shigowa, Nadia na hango Marwan tasan cewa akwai matsala, danma ta riga ta ajiye Abnal a hanya, zai karasa gida da Uber, tana fitowa daga mota Marwan Shima ya tashi daga inda yake zaune yayi hanyar shiga cikin asabitin, daya karaso inda Nadia take sai yace mata

"did he ask you to spend the night with him?" Marwan ya kuma tambayarta
"no not at all, i was the one that brought that idea, infact he was reluctant in accepting.." Nadia tafada da sauri dan the last she wants is aga laifin Abnal a wannan scenario din, Marwan knew that she was saying the truth cos Nadia is not the type that lie, she says the truth no matter how bitter it is
" but he accepted anyways, Nadia what came over you? How could you do such a thing? If your parents finds out how do you think they will feel?" Marwan ya jera mata waennan tambayoyin gently, cos situations like this one needs to be very cautious dan in yace zaiyi mata ihu yanxu, that scream or shout won't stop her from repeating the same thing tomorrow intayi niya, the right thing for him to do now is for him to make her realize and see that what they did was wrong, dukda he knows that he might not be the right person to admonish her cos he himself has done worst in the past, buh not withstanding 
"uncle i understand and know that what i did was wrong, buh i just got carried away last night, i had this strong need and want to be in his arms last night, buh i promise you that such will not repeat itself again" Nadia tafada mishi honestly cos she's free with her uncle like that, infact she's closer to Marwan than her dad, shiyasa most of the time Marwan is the one that decides for her, and any decision concerning Nadia that the dad wants to make sai ya tambayi Marwan tukunnan cos he knows that Marwan understands and knows her better 
"chuchu temptations will always come, is now left for you to know how to handle situations like that, one ought to have self decipline, so tell me did anything happened between the both of you?" Marwan ya karasa maganarshi da tambayar

"please don't say that, i just find it hard to believe that¬† Abnal doesn't love you, even the way he looks at you alone as if you're the only girl in this world is something, why not talk to him about this, I'm sure he will have a tangible explanation to give" sadiya suggested
"so that he will continue to lie to me? No I'm not telling him anything yet, i will wait till tomorrow and see if at all they will meet or not" Nadia tafada 
"you doing that will be nothing but a recipe for disaster, i believe you should have a discussion with him, cos you doing that simply means you don't trust him" sadiya adviced

Anty faty ta lura da yanda Nadia take and she's been asking her what the problem is buh Nadia taki tayi magana, and the reason why Nadia did not want to tell her mum anything is because tasan cewa ba lallai baneba uwar tayi supporting dinta, the only person she knows will support her one hundred percent is her dad, shiyasa taki tayiwa anty faty magana, da anty faty taga cewa Nadia is not ready to talk, rabuwa da ita tayi tana cewa 'in kin gama kukan and ubanki ya dawo i know you will talk' tafada while walking out of the room.

"yes, tana can" anty faty replied, hanyar staircase Alhaji Nasir yayi, yana shiga dakin Nadia, Nadia tazo tayi hugging dinshi while still crying, riketa Alhaji Nasir yayi yana shafa bayanta, saida Nadia tayi mai isarta sannan uban ya zaunar da ita akan gado while sitting next to her, seeing his daughter like this breaks his heart, sai yace
"who hurt you like this cookie?" ya tambayeta yana goge mata hawaye
"it's Abnal" Nadia replied 
"Abnal?" Alhaji Nasir asked surprise cos shi ganau ne a irin son dake tsakaninsu
"yes dad, he's been two timing me all this while, he never really loved me, he took the opportunity and advantage that I was in love with him and toyed with my heart" Nadia tafada cikin hawaye
"buh cookie are you sure?" Alhaji Nasir asked again still surprised 
"yes dad, i know it's hard to believe cos of how he pretended to be in love with me, buh he was still seeing his ex behind my back" Nadia explained 
"you mean to say he's been seeing his ex all this while?" 
"yes dad, all this while I've been the other woman in his life..." katseta Alhaji Nasir yayi ta hanyar cewa
"okay cookie, who told you all of this?" murmushi mai ciwo Nadia tayi sannan tace
"i wish it's someone that told me, the pain and heart break I'm feeling right now would¬† have been less, buh i caught them together myself and out of anger i gave him back his ring, there he told me that he was done with the relationship, he doesn't want me any longer"
"you mean to say Abnal told you that he was no longer interested in the relationship?" Alhaji Nasir asked just to be sure, cos he's having a hard time believing all what Nadia is telling him right now 
"yes dad, i guess all along he was looking for an excuse to break up with me, and now he found the perfect excuse" Nadia ta kuma fada tana goge fuskarta, numfasawa Alhaji Nasir yayi sannan yace
"if that's the case, i do not want you to shed tears over him again cos he's not worth it, you deserve better than him, remember when you showed your interest in the boy i warned you to be careful, buh that's all in the past now, what i want from you now is for you to focus on your career, try to forget about him, though i know it's easier said than done, buh i know you can do it cos you're a fighter" Alhaji Nasir ya fada mata cikin kwantar da murya
"yes dad, i know it's not gonna be easy for me buh, i promise you that from this minute, I'm not gonna brood or cry over him again, i can never be any man's second choice, i deserve better than that, i will just focus on myself and my career" Nadia tafada cikin confidence 
"that's my girl!, so now let's talk about other important things like your clinic, so how is the employment rate?" Alhaji Nasir ya tambayeta just for them to change topic
"it's coming quite well, i and uncle are almost through with the employment, everything is going as planned" Nadia ta amsa shi
"good to know, your focus should be on that, now zo mu sauka kasa i don't want only you to be locked inside here" alhaji Nasir yafada yana tashi tsaye tareda mika mata hannu alamar ta kama
"okay dad, buh you go on i want to freshen up, i will join you in a jiffy" Nadia replied tana tashi tsaye
"are you sure?" Alhaji Nasir ya kuma tambayarta
"yes dad, i already told you, Abnal is in my past now, no more crying or brooding over him, and you know that when i set my mind on something, i do it" Nadia replied while smiling, cos truly yanzu Abnal is history to her dan bata taba zata cewa Abnal zai iya kalli kwayar idonta ya fada mata cewa he's done with the relationship ba, that just shows how little she knows him, da wannan tunanin ta shiga bandaki. 

Da Alhaji Nasir ya sauko kasa, anty faty ta tambayeshi abun daya faru, nan Alhaji Nasir yayi mata bayanin komai, anty faty was totally speechless cos she just found it hard to believe all what her husband just told her, sai tace
"dear are you sure cewa that's what really happened? Cos it's just hard to believe cewa Abnal will say he's done with the relationship knowing how much he loves her" 
"okay, so you want to tell me that karya ko sharri tayi mishi yanzu, knowing fully well the type of daughter you have, lying is not her habit, inma zatayi karya sai ta rasa wanda zatayiwa sharri if not Abnal?" Alhaji Nasir ya tambayi anty faty in an angry tone, cos when it comes to maganar Nadia Alhaji Nasir always takes her side
" haba dear, ni bance karya ko sharri tayi mishi ba, all I'm trying to say is..." katseta Alhaji Nasir yayi ta hanyar cewa
" look woman, lets assume that babu abun daya faru tsakaninsu and Nadia decides that she's no longer interested in him, you know fully well that bazan taba yiwa any of my children forced marriage ba, so I'm using this opportunity and medium to plead with you, i do not want you to interfere or ask Nadia any question pertaining to this matter, ita ta kawoshi cewa she loves him, now she said she's no longer interested in the relationship, and even the boy said the same thing, so i do not see what the issue is here, i hope I'm communicating?" Alhaji Nasir ya karasa maganarshi da tambayar
" yes, and i promise you that i won't ask her anything" anty faty replied tana tashi tsaye
"that will be appreciated" Alhaji Nasir yafada shi yana zama, anty faty bata kuma amsa shiba tayi hanyar dakinta.

*_***SNEAK PEAK FROM MY NEXT BOOK 'QADDARAR JEDDERH' JEDDERH'S DESTINY '




"I'm gonna ask you a simple question that needs a yes or no answer, have you slept with that man that you were with?" Sadiq asked her in a very calm tone, Amma kallo daya mutum zaiyi mishi yasan cewa this his calmness is nothing but what we call 'calm before the storm', murmushin takaici Jedderh tayi sannan tace
" you must be a joker, i will pretend that you didn't just ask me that pervatic question, just move out of my way and let me go if at all you want me to forgive this stunt you pulled on me now" Jedderh tafada mishi cos Sadiq was standing between her and the door, babu yanda zata fita if at all Sadiq bai matsa daga hanyar taba
"answer the damn question!!!" Sadiq yafada cikin fushi, cos just the thought that there's a possibility nacewa Jedderh has been intimate with Mr Johnson is driving him nuts, Jedderh was shocked and taken a back by yanda Sadiq yayi ihu cos she wasn't expecting it, batasan lokacin data amsashi da 
"no i haven't slept with him, I'm just his date and nothing more" tafada while giving him a surprised look, Sadiq najin amsa dinta baisan lokacin dayayi ajiyan zuciya ba yana shafa fuskarshi frustratingly, Jedderh was just staring at him speechless cos she simply do not understand what's going on in Sadiq's head
"now that I've answered your question you should let me out, else you give me no option than to call anty maggy and explain all what you did to her, I'm sure you wouldn't want a lawsuit in your hand anytime soon" Jedderh tafada mishi confidently cos she has decided not to show an iota of fear, Da Sadiq yaji abun da Jedderh tafada sai ya ciro wayarshi tareda fara dannawa cos he knows what Jedderh said is true, anty maggy doesn't play with any of her girls, any form of maltreatment she will sue you, and the last thing Sadiq wants is a lawsuit on his office deck all because of an excort, so he decided to beat Jedderh to her own game by calling anty maggy himself, dan yanada number dinta awayarshi amma this is the first time dazai kirata da kanshi, harun has always been the one to do the calling, wayar nafara ringing Sadiq yasashi a handsfree, Jedderh was just standing there wondering who he was calling, not until taji muryar anty maggy ta daga wayar tana cewa 
"hello, good evening Sir" cos anty maggy has Sadiq's digits, and when she saw his call she was soo excited amma kuma tana dan fargaba cewa hope Sadiq is not calling to stop his patronage cos the last set of girls daya aika mishi he declined all of them, and¬† each one of those ladies were anty maggy's best, so she's worried cewa Sadiq is not finding her services worthy anymore and she wouldn't want to loose him as a client 
"so i will assume that you know who's on the line" Sadiq yafada mata
"yes sir, i do" anty maggy replied respectfully 
"okay, in that case let me go straight to the reason why I called you, i want the lady you sent to Mr Johnson to spend a month with me" Sadiq yafada authoritatively, cos he has decided to have Jedderh to his fill and a month should be okay for him, cos he really needs to get his sanity back, Jedderh najin abunda Sadiq yafada ta bude duk idanuwanta waje finding it hard to believe what she just heard him say, Amma she decided to keep mute and hear anty maggy's response first, 
"oh you mean Jedderh right?" anty maggy ta tambayeshi 
"i don't know whatever her name is" Sadiq replied arrogantly, Jedderh was just staring at him 
"that's her name sir, that shouldn't be a problem at all, buh it will cost you alot of money..." anty maggy tafara fada cos she really don't want to turn Sadiq's offer down after not being able to satisfy him for weeks, and again this is a very good business that will fetch her alot of money, katseta Sadiq yayi ta hanyar cewa
" that shouldn't be a problem, get your lawyers to meet mine and they both can settle things out, you just name your price" Sadiq yafada 
"okay sir, in that case she's all yours for the next one month" anty maggy tafada excitedly kafun Sadiq ya katse kiran yana bawa Jedderh kallon 'you're all mine now'. 
Jedderh couldn't believe cewa anty maggy just accepted Sadiq's demand just like that without asking her first, sai yanzu ta kuma sanin cewa batada gata, but God knows she's not spending a month with this egoistic bastard, tana gama wannan tunanin wayarta yafara ringing, tana dauka taga cewa anty maggy ce, dagawa tayi bayan sun gaisa anty maggy tayi mata bayanin proposal din Sadiq, there and then Jedderh tayi rejecting dinshi, sai anty maggy tace
"you don't get to reject a client, don't you want more money? If you don't need or want money, well i do, so you better make use of this opportunity that you have and secure your future, remember you're indebted and binded to the agency for the next five years, if you really do not want to stay with him for a month, then pay me the exact amount he's paying for your services" 
"anty maggy you of all people knows that i don't have the money to pay you..." Jedderh tafada pleadinly 
"in that case, you'll stay with him for a month and certisfy him in every possible way you can and i don't want any complaints from him about you, so you better behave yourself and be on your best behavior, good luck to you" anty maggy na gama fadan haka ta katse kiran. Jedderh was left dumbfounded, juyowa tayi ta fuskanceshi tace
"you this Sadistic bastard, you think you can buy me with your money, well I'm not for sell! So you better call anty maggy back and tell her that you're no longer interested in me, else you won't like what i have up my sleeve for you" Jedderh tafada mishi angrily thinking that her rude behavior might change Sadiq's mind, takawa zuwa gabanta Sadiq yayi while staring down at her yafara cewa
"you're nobody to tell me what to do or not to do, you're just a mere cheap whore that's needed to be taught a lesson cos you're rude, and don't think that this one month you're about to spend with me is gonna be an enjoyable one, no, far from it, it's gonna be hell on earth cos I'm gonna be having you my way, anyhow i want it you have no choice than to give it to me, you know why? Cos you're for sale and I've paid for a month out of your miserable life, so the earlier you shut that latrine you call a mouth the better for you", Sadiq na gama fadan haka sai ya juya yafita daga dakin tareda kulle Jedderh aciki.

"
"it better not happen again, but i will still insist that most men are not to be trusted, sefini!" laila tafada tareda fuskantar gabanta tana cigaba da gyara gashin kanta, karasa sa takalminshi Marwan yayi sannan ya tashi yaje yayi hugging dinta ta baya ya daura kanshi a kafadarta, hannunshi daya na rikeda ku'gunta while the other hand na shafa cikinta yace

"i will ask you a simple question, and all i want is a simple yes or no answer" laila tafada looking all serious, Abnal naganin countenance dinta yasan cewa she's furious, and one of the reasons why bai gaya mata komai ba is because tun asali laila never liked ruqayya one bit, so she won't even want to give him a listening ear had it been ya fada mata, Abnal was ready for anything so sai yace

What have come over you?, ko ka manta irin wahalar da tashin hankalin da wannan yarinyar da family dinta suka samu? , incase you forgotten let me help refresh your memory, ruqayya was the girl that left you when you needed her the most, she was the one that didn't care either you lived or died, she left you for richer guys and men, she and her mum together with her sister were the same ones that humiliated me when i went to plead with her to come see you when you were sick koda sau dayane, and all this time that she neglected you who was there? Nadia! She was beside you throughout your hard times, she cared for both you and me when we came to Abuja, even without her knowing who we really were, and the best way you think you could repay her was by two timing her with ruqayya? Really!!! I'm highly disappointed in you, just get lost, i don't wanna see you" laila ta karasa maganarta tana hawaye, cos she's really hurt by what she thinks Abnal has done, all this while Abnal was just standing there looking at her, cos he knows that nothing he says now will make sense to laila cos of how livid she is, so sai kawai yasa kai ya fice daga wajen.

"my dear it's because you did not see the type of warning that your father gave me nacewa i must not ask or tell her anything, and ita Nadiar dayake tasan cewa i will never support that her decision har yanzu yarinyannan batace mun komai gameda maganannanba, ni kuma nayiwa kaina alkawari cewa i wont say anything to her, haka zan zuba musu ido ita da uban, anyhow she wants to do her life sai tayi" anty faty na rufe baki saiga Nadia nan shigowa, tana ganin haseeba tace
"A'a ashe yan kasar waje sun dawo, babu ko sanarwa?" Nadia tafada tana murmushi
"ai dan ke na dawo dawuri" haseeba tafada tana kafeta da ido
"ni kuma? Mai akace nayi?" Nadia ta jera mata waennan tambayoyin while starring¬† back at her 
"why did you call off your engagement with Abnal?" haseeba asked while looking And sounding upset
"oh that! Well i realized that he wasn't good enough for me, you have a problem with that?" Nadia ta tambayeta itama tana kallonta a yatsina
"you must be out of your mind for asking me such stupid question, bakiji dadi  cewa you found a guy that's willing to love both you and shortcomings, that guy practically licks the ground you step on, da kika rabu dashi yanzu kin zata cewa zaki samu wanda zai soki da wannan banzan halin da matsalar insecurities dinki ne? Answer me?" haseeba ta fada mata a zafaffe
"a naji na kuma yarda cewa banda hali mai kyau, keda kike dashi ina ya kaiki? At 30+ bakida mashinshini, or better still why not kije kisamu Abnal ku auri juna, now that i think about it ma, you both fit each other" Nadia itama ta mayarwa haseeba magana azafaffe
"Nadia are you out of senses? What gave you the temerity to talk to your elder sister like that? Ko kin manta a gaban waenda kike tsaye ne?" anty faty tafada mata cikin daga murya
"mum don't worry,¬† i will take her up on her offer, badai tace we fit each other ba? No problem, zakiga aiki da cikawa kuwa" haseeba ta fada mata, Allah kadai yasan wane irin radadin da haseeba take ji yanzu, for your own younger sister that you're way older than ta kalli kwayar idonki tayi miki gori, it's very painful gskya 
"toh anty faty ni kice ta fita harkata, what's her business da zata ringa samun baki acikin lamarina, ai in babba bai ji kunyar hawan dokey ba, dokey bazaiji kunyar kayar da'ita ba" Nadia na gama fadan haka ta juya ta haura sama, anty faty ce ta kalli haseeba tareda daura hannu a kafadarta¬† tace
"no amount of words can quantify how sorry i am, kiyi hakuri kinji?" 
"ba Komai mum, Amma one thing is for sure, sai na koya mata hankali, wannan alkawari ne, badai tace ita mara kunya ce ba, sai na gasa mata aya a hannu" haseeba tafada looking all calm, cos she doesn't wanna loose her cool, dan if that happens, zata iya balla Nadia into two
"ai hakuri nake baki yanzu, banso kice zaki daketa dan girmankine zai kuma zubewa a idonta" anty faty ta fada mata, zama haseeba tayi tace anty faty itama ta zauna, bayan sun zauna, sai haseeba tace

"okay, what do you have in mind?" anty faty asked
"ga abunda zai faru, kindai san cewa Nadia doesn't know that I'm already in a relationship, ko kin gaya mata ne?" haseeba ta tambaya 
"a'a ban gaya mata komai ba" anty faty ta amsata
"very good, i will pretend that I'm in a relationship with Abnal just to make her jealous, cos nasan Nadia still loves him, she's just being a spoilt brat, i tell you mum that by the time she thinks I'm in relationship with him she will want him back" haseeba explained 
"but what of you and muhseen?" anty faty asked again looking confused 
"okay, bara nayi miki dalla - dalla, you and i both know that Abnal adores Nadia, it's clear as day, so za'a cigaba da shirye shiryen bikinsu tare danamu, buh my own relationship with muhseen will be kept away from her, everybody will know amma banda ita da sadiya, so we will present it to her kamar bikina dana Abnal ake shiryawa, I'm positive cewa intaga haka, she will want Abnal back, the reason why I'm willing to do all these for her even though she doesn't deserve it is because nasan cewa she will surely regret leaving Abnal"
"okay, naji duk bayananki, buh what if she's truly over Abnal and she doesn't care cewa both of you are getting married?" anty faty asked, murmushi haseeba tayi Sannan tace
"i know that will not happen, buh just incase if it does happen, sai a dakatarda nata shirye shiryen bikin, it's as simple as that" haseeba replied 
"well me i don't really have a say in all of this, if your dad, Abnal and muhseen all agrees to the plan, then so be it" anty faty said
"don't worry they will all agree, if dad comes back today i will talk to him" haseeba tafada tana haurawa sama. 

Daddare around 8pm Alhaji Nasir ne zaune a personal lounge room dinshi saiga haseeba nan tashigo, Alhaji Nasir na ganinta yafara murmushi yana cewa
"here comes the apple of my eyes, my angel, the one that always makes me proud" 
"dad don't flatter me cos you and i knows that I'm none of the above names you just called me" haseeba tafada tana zama kusada ubanta, daura hannu a kafadarta Alhaji Nasir yayi sannan yace
"haba, why would you say that? Kema kinsan cewa inaji dake ba kadanba" 
"naji amma ban yarda ba, the favour i came to ask of you, if you grant it,¬† then zan yarda cewa kana ji dani ta gaske" haseeba tafada
"okay, ask away.." Alhaji Nasir yafada with rapt attention, cos this will be the first time da haseeba zata zo tasameshi one on one to ask for a favour 
"i and muhseen are dating, infact zamu so ahada bikinmu danasu Yusuf" haseeba tafada tana kallon uban
"wow, that's a very good news, I'm soo happy to hear this, buh how is this a favour? On the contrary it's a delight for me" Alhaji Nasir yafada mata excitedly 
"actually that's not the favour i was talking about, the favour I'm here to ask is not for me rather its for Nadia" haseeba tafada
"Nadia?" the dad asked 
"yes dad, i heard the big mistake she made by calling off her engagement with Abnal over some flimsy excuse of hers and this is what i want to do..." nan haseeba tayiwa uban bayanin plan dinta ta karasa dacewa
"... Dad i understand that you might be thinking cewa what I'm about to do is childish, buh I'm positive cewa Nadia still loves Abnal deeply, she's only being a spoilt brat", numfasawa Alhaji Nasir yayi sannan yace
"I'm not disputing the fact that Nadia still loves him cos i caught her staring at his picture yesterday, buh the problem here is that Nadia told me that Abnal said he was done with the relationship, toh yanzu in munce zamu aiwatar da plan dinki, won't it look like we're begging him?", murmushi haseeba tayi sannan tace
"Abnal said that out of anger, Amma after that incident ai Abnal has apologized to her twice, and both times she insulted and humilated him, she's just using that one as an excuse" 
"you mean to say that Abnal apologized?" Alhaji Nasir asked surprised cos Nadia never told him that 
"yes, he apologized, ai bazata gaya maka wannan ba" haseeba tafada
"hmmm, yanzu ya kike gani cewa za'ayi?" uban ya kuma tambayarta 
"i will go explain everything to Abnal and muhseen tomorrow, nasan zasu yarda expecially Abnal, cos muhseen told me that he hasn't been himself since this incident happened, ko aiki ya daina zuwa, after that sai kai kayiwa Alhaji Habib bayanin danayi maka yanzu" haseeba explained
"it's Abu Yusuf (Alhaji Habib kenan) that's a bit issue, with the way i treated him by telling him to warn Abnal to stay away from Nadia, i don't even know how to tell him this" Alhaji Habib yafada looking confused 
"explain things to him, I'm sure he'll reason with you" haseeba persuaded 
"okay, i will talk to him ko zuwa jibi ne in Allah ya yarda" Alhaji Nasir yafada, hiran yaushe rabo ne suka cigaba dayi, kafun daga baya haseeba tayi mishi sai da safe. 

Washegari around 3pm haseeba ta isa gidansu Mami, bangaren Mami taje ta gaidata sannan itada muhseen suka dawo bangarenshi, amma gayawa mami tayi cewa she wants to check on Abnal, bayan sun zauna muhseen yake cewa
"babe you look a little bit disturbed, anything the problem?" 
"not really, just wanna discuss something with you" haseeba tafada mishi, kallon tuhuma muhseen ya mata sannan yace
"whatever you want to discuss should not involve you telling me not to make our relationship known, or you're not ready for wedding now, please"
"why are you jumping the gun? Atleast hear me out first" haseeba tafada tana murmushi 
"i just want us to be clear, cos if my dad returns today I'm telling him about us" muhseen yafada mata as a matter of fact 
"ai toh ni nariga ka, cos i already told mum and dad yesterday and they were excited" haseeba tafada mishi
"really?" muhseen asked in a sexy way yana matsa kusada ita, dakatar dashi haseeba tayi ta hanyar sa hannu a kirjin shi tace
"before anything, let's discuss what i came here for" 
"what could be more important than us?, whatever it is should wait, i just wannan enjoy this moment with you, i miss you soo much" muhseen yafada yana shinshina wuyarta
"i miss you too, buh i want us to discuss about Abnal and Nadia" muhseen najin sunan waenda ta kira ya dakata sannan ya kalleta yace
"what about them?" cos yanda yake jin Abnal a zuciyarshi baijin Yusuf that's his blood yana jinshi haka
"i have a plan, buh the plan involves us" haseeba tafada mishi 
"is there a possibility of this plan leading to their coming back together?" muhseen asked, cos dukda Abnal is claiming to be fine, he knows deep down he's hurting 
"yes.. " haseeba ta amsashi atakaice
"interesting, let's hear it" muhseen yafada yana gyara zamanshi sosai while facing her
"okay this is it..." nan haseeba ta gaya mishi komai, har maganar da Nadia ta fada mishi duk ta fada mishi 
"wow, you mean to say Nadia said that to you?" Muhseen asked surprised 
"yea she did, so you can see that she really needs a wake up call" haseeba ta amsashi
"well ta bangarena I'm willing to do anything to see Abnal happy again, so far its not gonna affect our relationship in anyway , then we should give it a try" muhseen agreed 
"thank you soo much baby, yanzu saura yanda zamuyi convincing din Abnal ya yarda" haseeba tafada
"i don't think that should be a problem" muhseen said 
"is he around?" haseeba asked 
"yes he is.." muhseen replied 
"okay, let's go tell him our plan and see" haseeba tafada tana tashi tsaye. 

A lounge area din Abnal, Abnal, haseeba da muhseen ne zaune, Abnal na tsokanan haseeba da cewa
"finally, our bride to- be is back" yafada yana murmushi 
"ai bakiga yanda shi da ya Yusuf suka ringa zolayata ba, buh now everything has come to an end, nima my baby is beside me now" muhseen yafada cikin raha, kurawa Abnal ido haseeba tayi sannan tace
"how are you doing?" ta tambayeshi sympathetically 
"I can't complain, atleast I'm still breathing" Abnal ya amsata cos he already knows why haseeba asked that question 
"well she came with a solution for both you and Nadia, and i think it will work out" muhseen yafada yana kallon Abnal, murmushi mai ciwo Abnal yayi sannan yace 
"look, i really appreciate you guy's¬† concern, buh i don't think I'm ready or willing to go through another back and forth or any further humiliation, Nadia made it clear that she doesn't want anything to do with me, and i think we should respect her decision"
"atleast hear me out first, and i promise you that this my solution doesn't involve you going to meet her or anything of sort" haseeba tafada mishi
"okay, if that's the case, out with it already" Abnal yafada eagerly, cos he's ready to try or do anything to get Nadia back, so far it doesn't involve him meeting or begging her one on one, dan this past few days, shi kadai yasan ya yakeji, he thought he will be over her with time, buh the whole thing is not working out the way he planned 
"okay, my plan goes like this...." nan haseeba ta kuma yimishi bayanin komai, when haseeba was through, Abnal was just staring at the both of them as if they grew horns in their head cos the plan sound weird to him, muhseen dayaga cewa shirun yayi yawa sai yace
" bruh say something.."
"what exactly do you want me to say? First off, How sure are you that Nadia still has feelings for me? Dan sai kanason mutum zakayi kishin sa, secondly, bruh haseeba is your fianc√©e, i mean it's somehow..." katseshi haseeba tayi ta hanyar cewa
"i totally understand what you're thinking and how you're feeling right now, buh believe me when i tell you that Nadia is still in love with you cos dad caught her staring at your pic while crying, and as for the plan, nothing we say or do is gonna be real, it's all pretense and iya gabanta kawai zamuyi, at the tail end it will be a win - win situation, cos you get your girl back, while i get my revenge back, cos someone really needs to teach that girl a lesson, she had the temerity to look me in the face and insult and mock me" haseeba tafada feeling hurt, babba ya zageka ma kaji haushi not  to talk of your younger sibling
"you mean to say she was staring at my pic?" Abnal ya tambayeta cos he's finding it hard to believe cewa Nadia is still in love with him and she could insult and humiliate him the way she did
"yes, very much in love" haseeba replied, muhseen, Abnal ya kalla with a heavy heart yace
"bruh you mean to say you're willing to do this for me? I mean we can always use another lady, this is your woman we're talking about here"
"okay, will you stop talking about me as if I'm not here? And as for your request, we can't use another lady cos that will be you looking like the bad guy she has tainted you to be, so she might not be that remorseful and hurt, buh if it's me, abun zaifi yimata ciwo sosai, and secondly if we use another lady how do i get my own revenge?", murmushi Abnal da muhseen sukayi, sannan muhseen yace
" don't worry bruh, I'm willing to do anything to see you happy again, buh i still find it hard to believe that Nadia will actually mock you like that" muhseen ya karasa maganarshi yana kallon haseeba 
"zata fada kam, she's saucy and witty like that" Abnal replied while still smiling 
"it's because you don't know her well enough, she's the type of person that bata tunani kafun tayi ko ta furta abu, she's brutally blunt like that, buh Time has come for her to learn cewa one doesn't eat their cake and still have it" haseeba tafada 
"okay so now that everything is settled, the remaining thing¬† is mu sanarda manyanmu, muga abun daza suce" muhseen yafada
"yes, dukda ni nariga na gayawa anty faty da Dad jiya, and they both were okay with the idea, so maybe upon your dad's return today, both of you can explain things and try to convince him to accept, if that's done, the only remaining thing will be the execution of our plan" haseeba explained.

 Bayan tafiyar haseeba, godiya Abnal ya kuma yiwa muhseen sosai, inda muhseen ya kuma jadadda mishi cewa karya damu cos he's willing to do anything just to see him happy again.

Daddare da Alhaji Habib ya dawo, bayan sunyi dinner sai muhseen da Abnal suka sameshi tareda yimishi bayanin plan dinsu, at first Alhaji Habib bai yarda ba, he was like what sort of child's play is that, Amma daya lura cewa Abnal himself is ready to go with the plan which only means he's still interested in Nadia, sai ya yarda amma with the condition cewa indai wannan plan dinsu baiyi aiki ba, Abnal will have to forget about Nadia for good, Abnal yace ya yarda. Dama already sunriga sungayawa Mami kafun dawowar Alhaji Habib, Allah ya bada sa'a kawai Mami tayi, dan all she's after is Abnal's health, indai wannan plan dinsu zaisa yaji dan dama dama then she's ready to go with it.
Washegari Alhaji Nasir ya ziyarci Alhaji Habib a office dinsa, after exchanging pleasantries Alhaji Nasir ya fadawa Alhaji Habib plan dinsu haseeba, ya karasa da bada hakuri cewa shi baisan cewa Abnal later apologized ba, Nadia never told him, shiru Alhaji Habib yayi for few seconds yana kallon Alhaji Nasir sannan yace
"Aboki kasan cewa i will always tell you my mind and the truth, cos ni nadaukeka a matsayin d'an uwane, those of us that know you, already knows that Nadia is your weakness, that fact is already established, buh when she came crying and complaining cewa Abnal has offended her in one way or another and she's no longer interested, what you were supposed to do was calm her down, then call Abnal and hear his own side of the story before judging or taking sides, buh you didn't do that, instead you took sides without hearing Abnal's own side of the story, and even me, baka bani the respect that i deserved ba, cos you practically came to warn me to tell Abnal to stay away from Nadia, not even considering the years we've spent together, haba Alhaji, if i tell you that i was happy with that toh nayi maka karya"
"look Abu Yusuf i know and understand that nayi ba daidai ba, that's why I'm apologizing now, and by Allah's willing i will call Abnal and apologize to him too cos i didn't behave the way i was supposed to, once again I'm sincerely sorry, and da yardar Allah such will never repeat itself again" Alhaji Nasir pleaded
"ai I'm not crossed with you, i just needed to say air what was on my mind, and about these children's plan, jiya muhseen da Abnal sunzo sun gayamun, and i agreed, so yanzu its no longer two weddings we have to plan for buh rather three, i don't know if you're aware that muhseen and haseeba are back together and he requested cewa dan Allah a hada aurensu danasu Yusuf , and i think its a good idea, Amma what do you think?" Alhaji Habib asked
"I'm aware cos haseeba told me already, and i too think it's a good idea, afterall they ain't children anymore, let's do everything once and for all musan mun huta" Alhaji Nasir replied, toh dama the only problem they would have had is money, toh Alhamdulillah Allah ya hore musu enough wealth that even if they want to sponsor more than ten weddings at once zasu iya and it will not affect them ko daya, not to talk of just three
"okay if that's the case, let's tell the women of the house (anty faty da Mami Kenan) afara shirye shirye, cos lokaci ya kure, we have less than two months now, kodai adaga bikinne?" Alhaji Habib asked
"no that won't be necessary, I'm sure all the preparations will be ready before the date with the right people on board, all we need do is relegate duties to various individuals and before you know it everything will be set" Alhaji Nasir replied
"okay, hakanma yayi" Alhaji Habib yafada
"in na isa gida yau zanyi magana da ummu haseeba, su fara all the necessary preparations, and i suggest you do the same too" Alhaji Nasir suggested
"In Shaa Allah, i will" Alhaji Habib replied.

Daddare Alhaji Nasir na isa gida ya tararda haseeba a lounge area, bayan haseeba ta gaida shi ya amsa, sai yake cemata yayi magana da Alhaji Habib yau and everything is in order, so tafara shiri, and she should please call Abnal and tell him to see him tomorrow around 7pm, godiya haseeba tayi mishi sannan Alhaji Nasir ya karasa dakinshi. Yana shiga saiga anty faty nan itama ta shigo, gaidashi tayi tareda tambayar shi how was his day, Da Alhamdulillah Alhaji Nasir ya amsata sannan ya nuna mata wajen zama kusa dashi akan gado, babu musu anty faty ta zauna, fuskantar ta Alhaji Nasir yayi ya rike mata hannu sannan yace
"i want to apologize for the way i treated you because of Nadia, i was just hurt seeing her in pain that day, buh i know that's not enough of an excuse for me to treat you the way i did, please find a place in your heart to forgive me, I'm really sorry for hurting you",murmushi mai ciwo anty faty tayi sannan tace
"i won't lie or pretend to you that i wasn't hurt, i understand that your love for Nadia is unexplainable, which is fine by me, buh don't treat me as if I'm not her mother or that i hate her, now dan yanda kake siding dinta in all that she does either good or bad, bata ganin kowa da daraja including me her mother, she thinks she can do anything and get away with it just because she knows that daddy will always support her, you're now making me look like a bad mother or the mother that doesn't love her..." katseta Alhaji Nasir yayi ta hanyar cewa
"c'mon don't say that..." katseshi anty faty tayi tana cigaba dacewa
"... That's the bitter truth here, if not, ace all that happened between her and Abnal, this girl did not see the need to tell me anything, cos she thinks i don't have a say whatsoever, and i don't blame her, it's the impression that you gave her, I'm not saying you shouldn't show her love, buh you also need to scold her whenever the need be, it doesn't pay ace me I'm scolding her duk lokacin datayi ba daidai ba and you you're always supporting her irrespective of what she does, parents needs to have one mouth piece when training their children, they need to support each other's decisions, if mummy says you're wrong or don't do this, daddy should support mummy's decision, same goes for mummy, let our children don't see division in our decision making, if not they will start taking sides, buh I'm glad that you've realized your mistake now, Allah dai ya ganar damu¬† baki daya" anty faty ta karasa fada
"Ameen, and I'm so sorry for making you feel this way, buh i promise you that hence forth you shall see changes" Alhaji Nasir yafada while cleaning her tears for her, cos anty faty was crying ne
"it's okay, I'm not upset anymore" anty faty tafada tana murmushi dan bata samun matsala da mijinta inba akan Nadia ba, the husband is always blind when it comes to maganar Nadia, wani irin blind love yake mata

***SNEAK PEAK FROM MY NEXT BOOK 'QADDARAR JEDDERH' JEDDERH'S DESTINY '




"I'm gonna ask you a simple question that needs a yes or no answer, have you slept with that man that you were with?" Sadiq asked her in a very calm tone, Amma kallo daya mutum zaiyi mishi yasan cewa this his calmness is nothing but what we call 'calm before the storm', murmushin takaici Jedderh tayi sannan tace
" you must be a joker, i will pretend that you didn't just ask me that pervatic question, just move out of my way and let me go if at all you want me to forgive this stunt you pulled on me now" Jedderh tafada mishi cos Sadiq was standing between her and the door, babu yanda zata fita if at all Sadiq bai matsa daga hanyar taba
"answer the damn question!!!" Sadiq yafada cikin fushi, cos just the thought that there's a possibility nacewa Jedderh has been intimate with Mr Johnson is driving him nuts, Jedderh was shocked and taken a back by yanda Sadiq yayi ihu cos she wasn't expecting it, batasan lokacin data amsashi da 
"no i haven't slept with him, I'm just his date and nothing more" tafada while giving him a surprised look, Sadiq najin amsa dinta baisan lokacin dayayi ajiyan zuciya ba yana shafa fuskarshi frustratingly, Jedderh was just staring at him speechless cos she simply do not understand what's going on in Sadiq's head
"now that I've answered your question you should let me out, else you give me no option than to call anty maggy and explain all what you did to her, I'm sure you wouldn't want a lawsuit in your hand anytime soon" Jedderh tafada mishi confidently cos she has decided not to show an iota of fear, Da Sadiq yaji abun da Jedderh tafada sai ya ciro wayarshi tareda fara dannawa cos he knows what Jedderh said is true, anty maggy doesn't play with any of her girls, any form of maltreatment she will sue you, and the last thing Sadiq wants is a lawsuit on his office deck all because of an excort, so he decided to beat Jedderh to her own game by calling anty maggy himself, dan yanada number dinta awayarshi amma this is the first time dazai kirata da kanshi, harun has always been the one to do the calling, wayar nafara ringing Sadiq yasashi a handsfree, Jedderh was just standing there wondering who he was calling, not until taji muryar anty maggy ta daga wayar tana cewa 
"hello, good evening Sir" cos anty maggy has Sadiq's digits, and when she saw his call she was soo excited amma kuma tana dan fargaba cewa hope Sadiq is not calling to stop his patronage cos the last set of girls daya aika mishi he declined all of them, and¬† each one of those ladies were anty maggy's best, so she's worried cewa Sadiq is not finding her services worthy anymore and she wouldn't want to loose him as a client 
"so i will assume that you know who's on the line" Sadiq yafada mata
"yes sir, i do" anty maggy replied respectfully 
"okay, in that case let me go straight to the reason why I called you, i want the lady you sent to Mr Johnson to spend a month with me" Sadiq yafada authoritatively, cos he has decided to have Jedderh to his fill and a month should be okay for him, cos he really needs to get his sanity back, Jedderh najin abunda Sadiq yafada ta bude duk idanuwanta waje finding it hard to believe what she just heard him say, Amma she decided to keep mute and hear anty maggy's response first, 
"oh you mean Jedderh right?" anty maggy ta tambayeshi 
"i don't know whatever her name is" Sadiq replied arrogantly, Jedderh was just staring at him 
"that's her name sir, that shouldn't be a problem at all, buh it will cost you alot of money..." anty maggy tafara fada cos she really don't want to turn Sadiq's offer down after not being able to satisfy him for weeks, and again this is a very good business that will fetch her alot of money, katseta Sadiq yayi ta hanyar cewa
" that shouldn't be a problem, get your lawyers to meet mine and they both can settle things out, you just name your price" Sadiq yafada 
"okay sir, in that case she's all yours for the next one month" anty maggy tafada excitedly kafun Sadiq ya katse kiran yana bawa Jedderh kallon 'you're all mine now'. 
Jedderh couldn't believe cewa anty maggy just accepted Sadiq's demand just like that without asking her first, sai yanzu ta kuma sanin cewa batada gata, but God knows she's not spending a month with this egoistic bastard, tana gama wannan tunanin wayarta yafara ringing, tana dauka taga cewa anty maggy ce, dagawa tayi bayan sun gaisa anty maggy tayi mata bayanin proposal din Sadiq, there and then Jedderh tayi rejecting dinshi, sai anty maggy tace
"you don't get to reject a client, don't you want more money? If you don't need or want money, well i do, so you better make use of this opportunity that you have and secure your future, remember you're indebted and binded to the agency for the next five years, if you really do not want to stay with him for a month, then pay me the exact amount he's paying for your services" 
"anty maggy you of all people knows that i don't have the money to pay you..." Jedderh tafada pleadinly 
"in that case, you'll stay with him for a month and certisfy him in every possible way you can and i don't want any complaints from him about you, so you better behave yourself and be on your best behavior, good luck to you" anty maggy na gama fadan haka ta katse kiran. Jedderh was left dumbfounded, juyowa tayi ta fuskanceshi tace
"you this Sadistic bastard, you think you can buy me with your money, well I'm not for sell! So you better call anty maggy back and tell her that you're no longer interested in me, else you won't like what i have up my sleeve for you" Jedderh tafada mishi angrily thinking that her rude behavior might change Sadiq's mind, takawa zuwa gabanta Sadiq yayi while staring down at her yafara cewa
"you're nobody to tell me what to do or not to do, you're just a mere cheap whore that's needed to be taught a lesson cos you're rude, and don't think that this one month you're about to spend with me is gonna be an enjoyable one, no, far from it, it's gonna be hell on earth cos I'm gonna be having you my way, anyhow i want it you have no choice than to give it to me, you know why? Cos you're for sale and I've paid for a month out of your miserable life, so the earlier you shut that latrine you call a mouth the better for you", Sadiq na gama fadan haka sai ya juya yafita daga dakin tareda kulle Jedderh aciki.

"dad i said so because he was two timing me, and i know he's gonna do the same to sis haseeba" Nadia said while still in tears
"cookie i really do not see the problem here, you said you do not want him, he agreed and moved onto your sister, infact za'a hada bikinsu tare danasu Yusuf , as for the cheating part cookie, that shouldn't be your problem anymore, let your sister handle that part herself" uban¬† yana gama fadan haka ya tashi tareda pecking dinta a goshi sannan yayi hanyar dakinshi cos seeing his precious jewel's face like this stricking with tears is really hurting him, uban na barin wajen haseeba ta fashe da wani irin mahaukaciyar dariya, juyowa gareta Nadia tayi ta kalleta tace
"i always knew you always wanted him, ain't you even ashamed of yourself? You're scrambling over your own little sister's left over, i soo much pity your life, you're such a disgrace to womanhood that you can't even find yourself a man of your own" Nadia tafada out of anger and jealousy, tashi tsaye haseeba Tayi, one look at haseeba's face zaka san cewa this lady is livid right now, the only thing stopping her from pouncing on Nadia right now is alkawarin data yiwa Abnal na cewa bazai daketa ba, matsa kusa da ita haseeba tayi sosai sannan tace
"if you do not want thunder to do press up on your destiny you better shut your trap right this instance before I shut it for you ', cos if you say another word, i will not spank you buh rather, i will so beat the hell out of you that by the time I'm through with you, you won't know what hit you, and if you want to dare me, say a word again and see" haseeba tafada mata seriously, the look on haseeba's face alone was enough for Nadia to know that she shouldn't dare her, dan inyazo kan fada, haseeba will soo beat her, cos stature dinsu ma ba daya ba, and gashi sukadaine a lounge area, babu mai kwatarta in haseeba ta fara jibgarta, sai kawai ta juya ta haura sama, haseeba na ganin haka tace

Sadiya watched all that transpired between haseeba da Nadia, and her prayer was kar Nadia ta kuma ce wani abun, cos if haseeba handles her, it's not gonna be funny, and she wouldn't be able to interfere cos haseeba is a no nonsense kinda lady. Bayan haseeba tabar lounge area din, sai sadiya tabi bayan Nadia, tararda Nadia tayi tana kuka a dakinta, zuwa tayi ta zauna kusa da ita without saying anything, cos since the day Nadia had misunderstanding with Abnal, and sadiya was trying to advise her on their way home and Nadia scolded her, sadiya has kept to herself likewise Nadia, Nadia ce ta kalleta tace
"can you imagine what's happening now? Sis haseeba is getting married to Abnal in less than two months, and dad is in support of it, i don't understand how he could do that to me" Nadia tafada painfully 
"i understand how you must be feeling right now, buh if at all Abnal was able to move on so quickly to your sister, then believe me when i say this, he doesn't deserve you cos he never really loved you, you're too good for him and you deserve better" sadiya tafada mata trying to console her
"you're actually right, i know he's gonna cheat on her cos he's still with ruqayya the real love of his life, so he just wanna use haseeba and dump her like he did to me, and if haseeba is too blind to see that, that's on her" Nadia tafada tana goge hawayenta, dan anata tunanin Abnal can never leave ruqayya, da wannan idea din sadiya tasamu ta kwantar mata da hankali.

"hey sis in law, how are you doing?" Abnal replied back, Nadia that has been thinking all sorts of things cos Abnal was taking too long to reply tunda taga cewa ya karanta message dinta, Nadia was soo glad when she finally saw cewa Abnal was typing, da message din ya shigo Nadia was heart broken all over again, wato he's referring to her as his sis in law

A week later

Yaune opening din clinic din Nadia, the past week has been tough for her, buh the anticipation of today yadan rage mata damuwa. As we all already know Nadia's clinic is very beautiful, all the necessary staff needed have been employed, both families and friends were present. Abnal bai samu daman zuwa da wuriba, cos he had an emergency at work that needed his attention, muhseen da haseeba came almost the same time, Nadia couldn't keep her eyes off the entrance door waiting to see ko Abnal zai zo. Around 4pm Abnal ya iso, akan idon Nadia ya shigo, sai ya kara wani irin kyau , that's if its even possible, inda muhseen da haseeba suke tsaye Abnal yaje ya samesu, bayan sun gaisa muhseen yake cewa
"if looks could make one disappear, bruh you wouldn't be standing here right now cos the rate din da yan'mata ke kallonka is alarming expecially one specific one that's in a yellow and black floral jumpsuit (Nadia yake nufi)" murmushi Abnal yayi sannan yace 
"you don't get tired of joking around, have you guys check the whole place out kodai tun zuwanku soyyayarku kuke sha?" Abnal ya tambayesu
"I'm capitalizing on this opportunity to spent time with my boo, buh you can go look around and come tell us how you find the place, afterall clinic dinkune" haseeba tafada mishi cikin zolaya, murmushi Abnal yayi sannan yace 
"bara na barku, let me go feed my eyes", yafada yana barin wajen, hanyar ICU yayi, Nadia da tun lokacin da Abnal ya shigo idonta nakanshi, tana lura da duk wabi abun dayakeyi, immediately dataga cewa Abnal yabar wajensu muhseen yayi hanyar ICU sai ta bishi a baya, sadiya tried to stop her buh she wouldn't listen, dakin dashi da Nadia suka kwana ranar da Nadia ta kawo shi asabitin ya bude ya shiga, the room is exactly as it was that day, gaban window din dakin yaje ya tsaya remembering and reminiscing that night, yana nan tsaye Nadia ta shigo dakin, he didn't need to turn around to know that she was the one cos of the scent of her cologne, gefenshi Nadia taje ta tsaya while staring at him tace
"hey there..", the first thing Abnal did was put¬† both of his hands in his trouser pockets just to avoid unwanted situations, sannan ya fuskanceta yace
"the CEO herself, how are you?" ya tambayeta yana murmushi, she looked exquisite in this her outfit, dukda tadan rame, buh to him she's the most beautiful thing he has ever set his eyes on, how he wish..., when his line of thought started straying he quickly stopped himself
"I'm not fine" Nadia replied sincerely hawaye na taruwa a idanuwanta, kurawa juna ido sukayi without saying a word cos their eyes were doing all the talking, Nadia ce ta katse silence din ta hanyar cewa
"I'm sorry.." tafada cikin hawaye
"sorry for what exactly?, the insults or the humiliation, which exactly is it? " Abnal ya tambayeta while having a serious look on his face 
"for not giving you a listening ear and not trusting you enough, for everything in general" Nadia replied 
"Nadia i thought what we had was real, that all those moments we shared were special, but you proved me wrong by gallantly walking out of the relationship, you insulted and humiliated me over an offence i never committed, and now you come tell me that you're sorry? Really?" Abnal yafada while still having a very serious look on his face 
" i know I'm to blame for ending our relationship, buh you simply can't accuse me of not loving you, cos i too think the same of you now, it wasn't even upto a complete week that i ended our relationship that you moved unto my sister, what should i call that?" Nadia itama ta tambayeshi while crying profusely, the only thing stopping Abnal from hugging and telling her the truth right now is because of Muhseen and haseeba, he wouldn't let them down like that, cos telling Nadia the truth will only make haseeba and Muhseen look stupid, if they could put their own relationship on a hold for him he simply see why he wouldn't reciprocate back the gesture, so sai yace
"well, what can i say, your sister was available when i needed someone to lean on, she's kind, loving, caring and matured, she's everything you were not and more, and she said you already gave us your blessing, that kince you're soo over me and she can have me, so i see no reason why you should complain when i only fulfilled your wish" Abnal yafada mata
"i swear i only said that out of anger which she knows..." dakatar da ita Abnal yayi ta hanyar cewa
"see Nadia, all of this is not necessary anymore cos as you already know, your sister and i are getting married in a months time, so do not worry, ban rike kiba a zuciya, i have already let bygone be bygone, so i suggest you focus on yourself and career, i wish you the very best life will offer" Abnal na gama fadan haka ya fita daga dakin, cos if at all he spends another minute there babu abub dazai hanashi rungumeta ya rarrasheta, yana fitowa yaga sadiya tsaye, sai yace mata
"please go in and console her" yana gama fadan haka yayi gaba abunsa. 
Meanwhile da haseeba ta lura cewa bataga Nadia kumaba and Abnal too is no where in sight, sai tace
"i think Nadia followed Abnal, let me go check on them before Abnal spoils our plan, cos i don't trust him when it comes to Nadia", dakatar da ita muhseen yayi ta hanyar cewa
"c'mon let them be, Abnal won't let us down, when he's not a baby, he knows what's at stake here" muhseen yafada mata, dan already shi yasan cewa Abnal wanted to see Nadia ne, tunda this is not his first time coming here, so maganar cewa he wants to look around was just an excuse. 
Abnal na isa indasu haseeba suke yace musu
"I'm going, any of you coming?" ya tambayesu da idanuwanshi dasukayi ja, shi kadai yasan ya yakeji yanzu, muhseen na ganin fuskarshi yace
"let's go together, babe i will call you later" ya karasa fada yana kallon haseeba, girgiza mishi kai haseeba tayi alamar cewa taji, sannan muhseen da Abnal sukabar wajen.

A hanyarsu ta zuwa gida muhseen dake tuki ya kalli Abnal dake gefenshi and in deep thought sai yace
"how did your meeting go with her?"
"fine, buh i don't know if i can continue with this plan bruh" Abnal yafada sincerely 
"i know it's not easy, buh you just have to be strong, we have less than a month to go" muhseen yafada mishi 
"i don't know, seeing her like that in pain really hurts, at the end of the day, she's not the only one hurting here" Abnal said while wiping his tears, dan shi kadai yasan irin radadin dayake ji acikin zuciyar shi yanzu
"or should we call off the plan?" muhseen asked concerned
"that will be me being ungrateful and letting you and haseeba down" Abnal replied, shiru muhseen yayi, da Abnal ya lurada worried look dake kwance a fuskar muhseen, sai ya kirkiro murmushi yace
"don't worry about me bruh, i will be fine", ajiyan zuciya muhseen yayi yana murmushi yace
"i hope so, majnun ta laila", dariya Abnal yayi jin sunan da muhseen ya kirashi dashi . 

A asabiti kuma, sadiya ce zaune kusada Nadia tana tambayarta 'how did it go?', 
"it's over sadiya, there's simply no turning back now, you know had it been cewa wata daban zai aura, i would have fought for his love back, i wouldn't mind being his second wife, buh even if i continue to plead with him, to what end? He can't marry if he's already married to my sister, so what's the point? You know this room and bed experienced our love, and no matter what happens i will forever cherish those moments. I don't even know how i will be able to forget all his kisses, now sis haseeba gets to enjoy all of that and more, sadiya that guy is a kisser.." dakatar da ita sadiya tayi ta hanyar cewa
" please stop thinking about stuff like that, you're only torturing yourself"
"don't worry sadiya, just let me say all i have to say today, i promise that after today i will make peace with my sister and wish them well" Nadia tafada with a sad smile on her face, haka Nadia ta cigaba da bawa sadiya labarin soyayyarta da Abnal zuwa lokacin da mutane suka watse, Alhaji Nasir ne yazo ya kira Nadia cewa tazo su tafi cos kowa sun tattafi tunda ranar is a Saturday, on Monday mai zuwa clinic din zai fara aiki fully.

"ehem you were saying.." 
"i said i came to apologize for everything, how i was rude to you and all the insult i said to you i take them back, please forgive me, and also to let you know that I wish both you and Abnal the very best" Nadia tafada tana hawaye, tsaya kallonta haseeba tayi for few seconds sannan tace
"stop crying.. " tafada¬† tana goge mata hawaye, cos she noticed that hardly a day goes by without Nadia shedding tears, duk tabi ta rame
"you know we might have our differences, but i want you to know one thing which is, that i love you, all what i say or do is out of the love i have for you, i know you still like my Aby, and i sincerely wish that i could leave him for you, buh i cant cos I'm already in love with him, he's every woman's dream, so handsome, nice and top it all he's soo damn romantic.." haseeba tafada in a dreamy way, by now Nadia's heart was boiling but she tried to maintaine her cool, amma saida discomfort din ya nuna a fuskarta, haseeba ce tacigaba dacewa
"... Let me not bore you with our romantic escapades, so my dear baby sis you're forgiven, buh I've been meaning to ask you for a favour.." 
"thanks for forgiven me, so what's the favour you want from me?" Nadia asked 
"i will like you to be my maid of honor, that's if you don't mind" haseeba tafada just to hear what she will say, if truly she has embraced the idea of¬† Abnal marrying her, wani irin pitiful murmushi Nadia tayi sannan tace
"I'm sorry i wouldn't be able to do that, i hope you understand" 
"no problem, i totally and perfectly understand" haseeba tafada while smiling dan dama tasan da kamar wuya tayarda
"well, let me get back to my room, i was in the middle of something when i decided to come see you" Nadia tafada tana tashi tsaye
"okay then, come give me a hug before you go" haseeba tafada itama tana tashi tsaye, hugging din juna sukayi kafun Nadia ta koma nata dakin. 
Nadia na fita daga dakin haseeba ta fashe da dariya, muhseen ta kira tace mishi ya duba wattsapp dinshi ta turo mishi da sak'o, Amma kafun ya bude yaje ya samu Abnal suji tare, aikam haka akayi, bangaren Abnal muhseen ya tafi, Abnal that tun jiya dayaga Nadia he hasn't been himself, tunanin yanda yaga tears stricken face dinta yaki barin brain dinshi, kwance yake adakinshi yana tunani saiga muhseen nan ya shigo, yazo ya zauna a gefenshi, yana cewa

"hello, good evening Sir" cos anty maggy has Sadiq's digits, and when she saw his call she was soo excited amma kuma tana dan fargaba cewa hope Sadiq is not calling to stop his patronage cos the last set of girls daya aika mishi he declined all of them, and¬† each one of those ladies were anty maggy's best, so she's worried cewa Sadiq is not finding her services worthy anymore and she wouldn't want to loose him as a client 
"so i will assume that you know who's on the line" Sadiq yafada mata
"yes sir, i do" anty maggy replied respectfully 
"okay, in that case let me go straight to the reason why I called you, i want the lady you sent to Mr Johnson to spend a month with me" Sadiq yafada authoritatively, cos he has decided to have Jedderh to his fill and a month should be okay for him, cos he really needs to get his sanity back, Jedderh najin abunda Sadiq yafada ta bude duk idanuwanta waje finding it hard to believe what she just heard him say, Amma she decided to keep mute and hear anty maggy's response first, 
"oh you mean Jedderh right?" anty maggy ta tambayeshi 
"i don't know whatever her name is" Sadiq replied arrogantly, Jedderh was just staring at him 
"that's her name sir, that shouldn't be a problem at all, buh it will cost you alot of money..." anty maggy tafara fada cos she really don't want to turn Sadiq's offer down after not being able to satisfy him for weeks, and again this is a very good business that will fetch her alot of money, katseta Sadiq yayi ta hanyar cewa
" that shouldn't be a problem, get your lawyers to meet mine and they both can settle things out, you just name your price" Sadiq yafada 
"okay sir, in that case she's all yours for the next one month" anty maggy tafada excitedly kafun Sadiq ya katse kiran yana bawa Jedderh kallon 'you're all mine now'. 
Jedderh couldn't believe cewa anty maggy just accepted Sadiq's demand just like that without asking her first, sai yanzu ta kuma sanin cewa batada gata, but God knows she's not spending a month with this egoistic bastard, tana gama wannan tunanin wayarta yafara ringing, tana dauka taga cewa anty maggy ce, dagawa tayi bayan sun gaisa anty maggy tayi mata bayanin proposal din Sadiq, there and then Jedderh tayi rejecting dinshi, sai anty maggy tace
"you don't get to reject a client, don't you want more money? If you don't need or want money, well i do, so you better make use of this opportunity that you have and secure your future, remember you're indebted and binded to the agency for the next five years, if you really do not want to stay with him for a month, then pay me the exact amount he's paying for your services" 
"anty maggy you of all people knows that i don't have the money to pay you..." Jedderh tafada pleadinly 
"in that case, you'll stay with him for a month and certisfy him in every possible way you can and i don't want any complaints from him about you, so you better behave yourself and be on your best behavior, good luck to you" anty maggy na gama fadan haka ta katse kiran. Jedderh was left dumbfounded, juyowa tayi ta fuskanceshi tace
"you this Sadistic bastard, you think you can buy me with your money, well I'm not for sell! So you better call anty maggy back and tell her that you're no longer interested in me, else you won't like what i have up my sleeve for you" Jedderh tafada mishi angrily thinking that her rude behavior might change Sadiq's mind, takawa zuwa gabanta Sadiq yayi while staring down at her yafara cewa
"you're nobody to tell me what to do or not to do, you're just a mere cheap whore that's needed to be taught a lesson cos you're rude, and don't think that this one month you're about to spend with me is gonna be an enjoyable one, no, far from it, it's gonna be hell on earth cos I'm gonna be having you my way, anyhow i want it you have no choice than to give it to me, you know why? Cos you're for sale and I've paid for a month out of your miserable life, so the earlier you shut that latrine you call a mouth the better for you", Sadiq na gama fadan haka sai ya juya yafita daga dakin tareda kulle Jedderh aciki.

"you're such a lousy lier, i know it's because of haneefa that's why you're like this, thank God i Already told you About her, the reason why I'm being this particularly lenient with her is because she's suicidal, though she's out of the woods now but she's not completely fine, so banso abun dazai sa taji cewa kamar nobody loves her, shiyasa, and Angel I'm not saying that you shouldn't express yourself expecially if you're not happy about something, you're free to be jealous dan it's halal, abunda ba'aso shine you going overboard with it, or blowing things out of proportion, thank God you heard all what she said" Abnal yafada mata cikin lallami

Few years later

A lot has happened in the past years, laila has four children now, the twins and two other girls, her restaurant now has other branches around the country, ta kuma zama wata hamshekiya, kullum kara nuna mata so Marwan yake, she simply can't ask for any other thing, sai godiyar Allah, anty zee ta dawo Abuja da zama cos Marwan ya samo mata aiki a federal hospital dake Abuja, zumuncinsu kara karfi yake day in day out, Allah yabarmu da masoyanmu na kwarai, Ameen. 

Haseeba da muhseen suma sunada ya'ya biyu, a boy and a girl, haseeba is still her normal career driven woman and she's climbing the success ladder gracefully, and muhseen is very supportive cos most of the time if the need arises for haseeba to travel out of the country, he takes on the role of both mom and dad for their children, though sunada masu aiki da kulada yara. 



Sameera da Yusuf suma ya'yansu biyu yanzu, duk maza, while the third is on its way, they both are happy, sameera ita bata aiki sai business din siyarda kaya da takeyi, and Alhamdulillah she's making good profits, sai fatan Allah ya rabata lafiya. 




Nadia and Abnal's love is growing day in and day out, Nadia bata dade da haihuwa ba cos she didn't conceive early, and in all those years Abnal wasn't bordered cos yasan haihuwa ta Allah ne, instead he has always been the one to calm and cheer Nadia up whenever the issue wants to weigh her down, when finally Nadia got pregnant, zo kuga murna, it was as if ba'a taba haihuwa a family din ba. She gave birth to a baby girl, yanzu watanta 6 da haihuwa, they couldn't be much more happier, Nadia is now used to the way girls flock around Abnal and has come to learn to trust him. Her clinic is gradually turning into a hospital while Abnal's agency too is now one of the most recommended consulting agency in the country, sai fatan Alheri agaresu. 


Sadiya itama ta haihu, ya'yanta biyu, both girls, zumuncinta dana Nadia na nan, it's stronger now than ever before, and her business too is booming, her husband was promoted at his place of work, she can't thank  Nadia's family enough, sai dai kullum intayi Sallah tasasu a adduanta, Allah ya saka musu da mafificin Alheri. 

Ruqayya too is happy in her home, buh matsalarta shine uwargidanta, dukda ba'a gida daya sukeba, the woman doesn't give her peace of mind, the only saving grace is that her husband is on her side, and she has just a child, after that her son, bata kuma haihuwa ba. While her own sister is yet to born, sai addua Allah ya azurta ta da ya'ya masu Albarka, Ameen. 



Haneefa kuma abokin Abnal wanda Abnal yayi referring dinta to, shi ya aureta, har bikinsu Nadia da Abnal sunje.
